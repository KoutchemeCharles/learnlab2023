**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

One byte is comprised of 8 bits. A typical computer program has a requirement
for much more memory. Therefore, many bytes can be grouped together to make
larger memory amounts. Our convention is for computer memory is scaled in
logical increments of 210 = 1024.

For example:

  * 1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte (KB)
  * 1024 KB = 1 megabyte (MB)
  * 1024 MB = 1 gigabyte (GB)

Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and then outputs
the equivalent number of kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes.

The basic unit of computer memory is a bit. A bit can represent two values (on
or off, 0 or 1). To represent more information, bits are grouped together in
larger quantities. Beyond a bit, the next logical grouping is a byte, where 1
byte has 8 bits. Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits
and then outputs the equivalent number of bytes.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

In Star Trek, starships travel across interstellar space at many times the
speed of light.  Due to the immense speeds involved, velocity in Star Trek is
described using a fictitious unit of measurement known as a ""Warp Factor"".
For reference, Warp Factor 1.0 is equivalent to the speed of light, whereas
Warp Factor 9.0 is more than 700 times faster!

Write a program that asks the user for the number of starships to analyze, as
well as a target distance in light years.  Your program will then get the name
of each starship (e.g., ""USS Enterprise) as well as its maximum cruise speed
(e.g., 9.6), in that order.

Your program will then output the following:

  * The number of days it would take for the fastest starship to travel the target distance
  * The names of all ships that can travel the same distance within 7 days (inclusive) of the fastest time



**HINT:   We have provided you with a function called calculate_travel_time,
which takes a warp factor and distance as parameters, and returns the number
of days it would take to travel that distance.  Call this function to solve
the problem.**



**EXAMPLES:**

  | **Example 1** | **Example 2**

appears (NOTE: keep it simple, and split on the "" ""). Finally, let the user
type a token, and print how many times that token appears (if a word is not in
your dictionary, print 0).

how many years men and women spend in school in different countries. In the
problem, we have provided you with a dataset called `education.csv` that
contains information from various countries about years spent in education.
Here is a typical line from the file:

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Zimbabwe | 2010 | M | 15 | 64 | 8.04 | 5.92 | 2.09 | 0.03 | 3926  
  


  
Write a Python program that asks the user for the name of country (e.g.,
""Zimbabwe""), followed by a Gender (""M"" or ""F""). Your program should print the
average number of years that gender spends in school followed by the years
that are greater than or equal to the average.

  
For example, if ""Zimbabwe"" and ""M"" were entered as the country and gender of

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Using PythonGraph, create a simple paint application. Your program should draw
circles on the window whenever the user presses the left mouse button. Your
program should also listen for keyboard inputs, and allow the user to change
colors and the size of the circle by pressing on different keys.

A simple paint program has been provided to you as a starting point. Study the
code and make the necessary modifications.

When you are finished, upload your python code.


The answer should be code only, please do not provide explanations. Please put the answer within the fenced code block. ","

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity | Name | Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the most popular and working down.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

Write a Python algorithm that gets a number, `X`, from the user, and prints
out the X most popular names, starting with the most popular and working down.

For example, if the user types `5`, and you determine that the five most
popular names are Adrian, David, Bob, Jane, Ulysses, your program should
output:  
Adrian  
David  
Bob  
Jane  
Ulysses  
  

**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * For this lab, you need to sort the list in descending order, so that the most popular items appear first. To do this, you need to tell the function to sort in reverse. You can do this by typing the following (assuming your list is named `my_list`):  
`my_list.sort(reverse=True)`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This program makes use of the traffic.csv dataset. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`691,6067 North,Kimball Ave,8/15/06,15600,North Bound:7500/South Bound:8100`



  
As you will recall from class, each position in the line (separated by a
comma) represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key for your
reference:

ID | Address | Street | Sample Date | Total # of Passing Vehicles | # of
Vehicles by Direction  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
691 | 6067 North | Kimball Ave | 8/15/06 | 15600 | North Bound:7500/South
Bound:8100  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that opens the file and outputs the lowest traffic
count. Then, output the name of all streets whose traffic count is within 2500
(inclusive) of the min. Output one street name per line.



For example, if the min value is 500, and the roads within 2500 of this value
are ""Road A"", ""Road B"", ""Road C"", then your program should output:

    
    
    500  
    Road A  
    Road B  
    Road C

the end of the input. The user entered names (not counting 'END') are to be
stored in a Python list. The user will enter the names one at a time. After
entering all the names, your algorithm will print the names in the reverse
order that they were entered.

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 0 | 3 | Mr. Owen Harris Braund | male | 22 | 1 | 0 | 7.25  
  


Write a Python algorithm that asks the user for the name of the file
containing the titanic dataset. Your program will output the name of the
survivor with the lowest fare. Print that person's name in a separate file
(named ""result.txt"")

For example, if the survivor's name is Mr. Owen Harris Braund, result.txt

    Mr. Owen Harris Braund  
    7.25

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** Write a Python algorithm that asks the users for two ASCII characters
(e.g., 'a', 'z'), and prints all of the characters between them (inclusive).

  * If the first character has a lower ASCII value than the second (e.g., 'a' - 'z'), print out the letters in ascending order.
  * Alternatively, if the second letter has a lower ASCII value, print out the letters in descending order.



**HINTS:**

  * Use the `ord()` function to convert a character into an integer:  
`ord('a')` returns 141  
  

  * Use the `chr()` function to convert an integer back into a character:  
`chr(142)` returns 'b'

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.

**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** Write a function that determines if a point is within a circle. You will
name your function `in_circle()`. It has five parameters:

  1. The coordinates of the point that is to be tested (x, y)
  2. The center of a circle (cir_x, cir_y)
  3. The radius of the circle (radius)

 The `in_circle()` function will return **True** if the point is on or inside
the circle, and **False** otherwise.

**IMPORTANT:  
** You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you
test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you
can comment out your test code).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

**IMPORTANT:  
** You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you
test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you
can comment out your test code).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a dataset called `afpft_v2.csv` that describes how
various Air Force personnel performed on their most recent fitness test. Do
NOT ask the user for the file name--just open and read this specific file.
Here is a typical line from the dataset (each line ends with the newline ""\n""
character):



`38, 52, 29, 568`



Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element,"" or ""column."" The following table shows how the above line can be
interpreted:  
  

  | Sit Ups  
(Reps) | Push Ups  
(Reps) | Waist  
(inches) | 1.5 Mile Run Time  
(seconds)  
---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 45 | 65 | 32 | 630  
  


**Write a Python program that analyzes this file and prints the # of
_unsatisfactory_ (less than 75) scores. **



To assist you, we have provided you with a module called `fitness_calculator`
that contains four functions:

  * calculate_waist_score
  * calculate_pushup_score
  * calculate_situp_score
  * calculate_run_score



Each function takes a single number as a parameter, and **returns** the score
for that category. For example, to get the score for an Airman who did 45
pushups, you could import the module and call it, as follows:

    
    
    pushup_score = fitness_calculator.calculate_pushup_score(45)



To get a single Airman's total score, simply calculate the score for each
category and add them up.

    
    
    score = waist_score + pushup_score + situp_score + run_score



**EXAMPLES:**

If, for example, the number of unsatisfactory scores is 10, your program

will name your function `calculate_buoyancy`, and it will have the following
parameters (in this order):

  * Submerged Volume
  * Density
  * Gravity

Our function will  **return**  the buoyancy force, which can be computed using
the following equation:

**Fb = Vs × D × g **where Fb is the buoyancy force, Vs is the submerged
volume, D is the density of the fluid the object is submerged in, and g is the
force of gravity.

NOTE: You do NOT need to call the function.


The answer should be code only, please do not provide explanations. Please put the answer within the fenced code block. ","

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a list called `list_of_bases`. Write a program
that prints a single, specified base from the list. Your program shall take a
number via user input used to identify which base to print. For example, if
the user types a 3, you should print out the third item.



**NOTE:**

  * You may assume that the user will always enter a value that ""should"" exist within the list (e.g., the user will not enter 100 when the list only contains 5 elements)


The answer should be code only, please do not provide explanations. Please put the answer within the fenced code block. ","list_of_bases = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
index = int(input(""Enter the index of the base you want to print: ""))

Write a program that asks the user for:

  * a Pokemon Type (e.g., ""Electric""). 



Your program should then analyze the file and print:

  * The value of lowest Special Attack from a Pokemon with the matching type
  * The name of the Pokemon with the lowest value of Special Attack. In the event of a tie, print out the name of the FIRST Pokemon that matches.



**EXAMPLE:

You have a personal woodshop and want to easily calculate whether you can
afford the board materials for a project. It is unlikely you can obtain the
exact amount of board materials that you may need for the project because wood
planks are provided in fixed lengths.

  *     * The total length of board materials required for the project
    * The budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The number of boards needed for the project (Hint: use math.ceil(VALUE) to round up to the next full board).
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of boards is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.



Assume your local lumberyard sells each board in **5.33** feet pieces at
**$45.25** per board. You may assume that all inputs are non-negative numbers.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a Python program with the definition of a new function named fastest_car
and takes two lists of car info as parameters. The function will then
**return** the car model name with the higher top speed or ""Same speed"" if the
top speeds are the same.

The two parameters to the function are both a list with the same 3 types of
elements, as follows:

  
| **Car Model** | **Cost** | **Top Speed**  
---|---|---|---  
**Value** | Ford Mustang | 27205.00 | 163

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a Python program that obtains two whole numbers that represent the start
and stop values for a range of numbers. You may assume the second number is
always greater than the first.

Using these start and stop values, print the two following items in order:

1.  Print a list that starts at the start value and ends at (the list contains) the stop value

**HINT** : Use `range()` to accomplish this. In order to print the result from
range() as a list, surround it with list(), `list(range(#,#))`, like you
surround input() with int() or float(), `int(input())`.

2.  Print the size (how many numbers are contained) of that list

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** You have been provided with the template code for an animation.  Study the
code for a minute, then perform the following tasks:

  * In the `draw()` function, add one line of code that draws a circle.  
For the center, use the `ball_x` and `ball_y` variables defined in the
template.  
  

  * In the `update() function`, add code that modifies the value of `ball_x` and `ball_y`.  
For example, add 1 to the `ball_x` and subtract 1 from `ball_y` every time
`update()` is called. What do you expect to happen? Does what actually happens
match your expectations?

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity  | Name |  Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC  | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the least popular and working up.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

Write a Python program that takes two inputs and produces two outputs. NOTE:
This problem does not require creating an additional list to solve.

The inputs from the user are:

  1. A gender, a string which will be 'MALE' or 'FEMALE'
  2. A threshold number for the number of times that a name was used.

Your program will compare the information from the user to the 'names.csv'
dataset, and output two statistics as output:

  1. The count of the number of names that were used above the threshold given for the provided gender
  2. The total count of children with the high usage names and the specified gender. In other words, the sum of the number of children given names above the threshold value from input 2.



This problem makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You have been asked by your unit to record 100m dash times for an upcoming
USAFA track meet. Create a Python algorithm that first asks for the number of
cadets, and then asks for that many cadet last names, squadrons, and 100m dash
times (in that order).

Your program should output:

  * The cadet squadron containing the cadet with the fastest 100m dash time followed by their 100m dash time. If there is a tie for fastest 100m dash times, you should output the squadron number and time for the LAST cadet entered who had that fastest time.
  * The number of cadets whose 100m dash time was faster than the average.

There is no bound on the number of cadets that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one cadet and track time entered.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This program makes use of the Runways dataset. Here is a typical line from the
file:



`17245.8*A ND17/35, RICKETYBACK FIELD, 2600, 100, TURF`



  
Each position in the line represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key
for your reference:

  | Location ID | Name | Runway Length (in feet) | Runway Width (in feet) |
Runway Type  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 17245.8*A ND17/35 | RICKETYBACK FIELD | 2600 | 100 | TURF  
  
  
  
Write a Python program that asks the user for the name of the file containing
the Runways dataset, as well as the length and width of the runway. Your
program should print the Location ID of every runway whose length and width
meets or exceeds the specified values.

For example, if the user types 4000 and 100 for length and width,
respectively, your program should output:

    
    
    17265. _A ND03/21  
     17265._A ND13/31  
    17302. _A ND13/31

**

Write a program that asks the user to type the name of a file (e.g.,
""file.txt""), and a letter. Your program should then open the file, and print
out all of the lines where the first character starts with the letter

For example, if the user types the following filename:

    
    
    input1.txt
    a
    

and the contents of input1.txt are:

    
    
    aspiration
    classified
    federation
    

the output should be:

    
    
    aspiration
    



Notes:

  * Each line ends with the '\n' character. Use `split()` to get each line.
  * Refer to the String Functions slide to see how you can get the first character from a string

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

** You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you
test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Recreational SCUBA divers have to plan out how many air tanks they will need
in order to safely dive. The amount varies per diver because each person
consumes air at a different rate. This rate is commonly called Surface Air
Consumption. You want to figure whether you can afford the air requirements
for the trips that you are planning.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The total dive time for the trip in minutes 
    * The air budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The number of liters needed for the project.
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of compressed air is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.



Assume that your Surface Air Consumption is **14.5** liters/minute, and that
air costs **2 cents** per liter. You may assume that all inputs are non-

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

The CSAF has authorized new runways for any base that can accomplish the
project under their current budget. The new runways will be solid concrete
with their lengths measured in meters.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The length of runway to be built (in meters)
    * The base's budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The amount of concrete (in tons) needed for the base's runway
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of materials is greater than or not greater than the base's budget, respectfully.

Assume that each meter of runway requires **  2.5** tons of concrete to build,
and that concrete costs  **$75.50**  per ton. You may assume that all inputs
are non-negative numbers.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

A 3D printer converts computer generated models into physical objects by
heating and extruding a filament known as Polylactic Acid (PLA). PLA, normally
sold in spools, is directly fed to the printer head like a thread. You want to
determine if you can afford to 3D print a project given its volume of
material.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The volume of the 3D model to be printed (in cm3)
    * The user's budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The length of material (in meters) needed to produce the object
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of materials is greater than or not greater than the user's budget, respectfully.

Assume that each cm3 requires **  0.312** meters of PLA to print, and that PLA
filament costs  **$0.063**  per meter. You may assume that all inputs are non-
negative numbers.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a dataset containing information about various
types of Pokemon. Here is an example entry from the file:

    
    
    25, Pikachu, Electric, 35, 55, 40, 50, 50, 90, 1, FALSE



Each position in the line represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key
for your reference:

  | **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Hit Points** | **Attack** | **Defense** |
**Special Attack** | **Special Defense** | **Speed** | **Generation** |
**Legendary**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 25 | Pikachu | Electric | 35 | 55 | 40 | 50 | 50 | 90 | 1 | False  
  


Write a program that asks the user for:

  * a Pokemon Type (e.g., ""Electric""). 



Your program should then analyze the file and print:

  * The highest attack rating from a Pokemon with the matching type
  * The name of the Pokemon with the highest attack rating. In the event of a tie, print out the name of the FIRST Pokemon with the highest attack value.



**EXAMPLE:  
** If, for example, the Electric Pokemon with the highest attack rating is
Raichu (with an attack of 90.0), your program should print out:

    
    
    90.0  
    Raichu



NOTE: The above answer is purely hypothetical. Your answer will be different.

equal to or above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Commandant's List"". Finally, if
the cadet qualifies for all three individual lists, then the cadet is on the
""Superintendent's List"". The algorithm should report all the lists the cadet
is on (in the order defined above), unless the cadet is on the Superintendents

for much more memory. Therefore, many bytes can be grouped together to make
larger memory amounts. Our convention is for computer memory is scaled in
logical increments of 210 = 1024.

or off, 0 or 1). To represent more information, bits are grouped together in
larger quantities. Beyond a bit, the next logical grouping is a byte, where 1
byte has 8 bits. Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

**IMPORTANT:  
** You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you
test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you
can comment out your test code).

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity  | Name |  Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC  | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the least popular and working up.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

Problem description:
**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a Python program that takes two inputs and produces two outputs. NOTE:
This problem does not require creating an additional list to solve.

The inputs from the user are:

  1. A gender, a string which will be MALE or FEMALE
  2. A threshold number for the number of times that a name was used.

Your program will compare the information from the user to the names.csv
dataset, and output two statistics as output:

  1. The count of the number of names that were used above the threshold given for the provided gender
  2. The total count of children with the high usage names and the specified gender. In other words, the sum of the number of children given names above the threshold value from input 2.



This problem makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:

`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`

Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity | Name | Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC | GIA | 21  
  


**EXAMPLES:**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a Python algorithm that opens the file and outputs the lowest (minimum)
traffic count.  Then, output the name of all streets whose traffic count is
within 2500 (inclusive) of the minimum.



This program makes use of the traffic.csv dataset. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`691,6067 North,Kimball Ave,8/15/06,15600,North Bound:7500/South Bound:8100`



As you will recall from class, each position in the line (separated by a
comma) represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key for your
reference:

ID | Address | Street | Sample Date | Total # of Passing Vehicles | # of
Vehicles by Direction  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
691 | 6067 North | Kimball Ave | 8/15/06 | 15600 | North Bound:7500/South
Bound:8100  
  
  
  
Output one street name per line.



For example, if the min traffic count is 500, and the roads within 2500 of
this value are ""Road A"", ""Road B"", ""Road C"", then your program should output:

    
    
    500  
    Road A  
    Road B  
    Road C

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** Write a Python algorithm that asks the users for two ASCII characters
(e.g., 'a', 'z'), and prints all of the characters between them (inclusive).

  * If the first character has a lower ASCII value than the second (e.g., 'a' - 'z'), print out the letters in ascending order.
  * Alternatively, if the second letter has a lower ASCII value, print out the letters in descending order.



**HINTS:**

  * Use the `ord()` function to convert a character into an integer:  
`ord('a')` returns 141  
  

  * Use the `chr()` function to convert an integer back into a character:  
`chr(142)` returns 'b'

**PROBLEM NAME:  
** IterLogic1_dvc



**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.



**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

Problem description:
**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** Using the Bouncing Ball from the previous lab as a starting point, generate
an animation of a bouncing triangle. The triangle's vertices should start at
random locations, and bounce whenever the triangle hits a wall.





**HINTS** :

  * Try drawing 3 bouncing balls on the screen.
  * Once the balls are moving correctly, draw 3 lines to connect them!
