**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write an algorithm that gets a decimal GPA, APA, and MPA from the user (in
that order). You may assume that all inputs are non-negative whole numbers.

It then reports which meritorious list the cadet is on. If the GPA is equal to
or above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Dean's List"", and if the APA is equal to or
above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Athletic Director's List"", and if the MPA is
equal to or above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Commandant's List"". Finally, if
the cadet qualifies for all three individual lists, then the cadet is on the
""Superintendent's List"". The algorithm should report all the lists the cadet
is on (in the order defined above), unless the cadet is on the Superintendents
List, in which case, it should report only, ""Superintendent's List"".

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You have been provided with a file called oscar_age_male.csv, which contains
information about male oscar award winners from the 1920s to 2015. Here is a
typical line from the file:

    
    
    1928,44,Emil Jannings,The Last Command

As always, each data element corresponds to a different piece of information.
Here is a table that describes how to interpret each column:

**Year** | **Actor Age** | **Name** | **Film**  
---|---|---|---  
1928 | 44 | Emil Jannings | The Last Command  
  


Write a Python program that reads this file, and gets the following inputs
from the user:

  *     * A start year
    * An end year

Your program should output the age of the youngest actor during that time span
(including the start and end years), as well as the names of all actors that
are within 5 years (inclusive) of the youngest age. For simplicity's sake,
don't try to calculate the current age of the actors; just go with what is in
the file.



For example, if the youngest actor is 25, and the names of the actors within 5
years of the youngest age are Bob and Tom, your program should output:  
  
25  
Bob  
Tom

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:

In Star Trek, starships travel across interstellar space at many times the
speed of light.  Due to the immense speeds involved, velocity in Star Trek is
described using a fictitious unit of measurement known as a ""Warp Factor"".
For reference, Warp Factor 1.0 is equivalent to the speed of light, whereas
Warp Factor 9.0 is more than 700 times faster!

Write a program that asks the user for the number of starships to analyze, as
well as a target distance in light years.  Your program will then get the name
of each starship (e.g., ""USS Enterprise) as well as its maximum cruise speed
(e.g., 9.6), in that order.

Your program will then output the following:

  * The number of days it would take for the fastest starship to travel the target distance
  * The names of all ships that can travel the same distance within 7 days (inclusive) of the fastest time



**HINT:   We have provided you with a function called calculate_travel_time,
which takes a warp factor and distance as parameters, and returns the number
of days it would take to travel that distance.  Call this function to solve
the problem.**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You are writing a program to determine which aircraft  can fly in formation
based on their (min) safe cruise speed. Write a python program  
that asks the user for:

  1. The number of aircraft to analyze
  2. The target cruise velocity, in mph



Your program will then repeatedly ask the user for the designator for each
aircraft and its cruise velocity. Once all of the values have been input, your
program will output:

  1. The NUMBER of aircraft whose cruise velocity is within 50mph of the target (above or below, inclusive)
  2. The designator of each aircraft that meets the above criteria

**

Write an algorithm that asks the user for X and Y coordinates of a single
point (the coordinates of the top left point on the triangle), the length of
the base, and the height of a right triangle. Then, open a graphics window and
draw the triangle. The area of the triangle is should be displayed at the
bottom center of the window in black.



**HINTS:**

  * Make sure you get the user input BEFORE you open the window. Otherwise, the program will freeze.
  * The `draw_text` function will draw text on a screen. Don't worry about getting the text EXACTLY in the center (it's hard!).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity | Name | Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the most popular and working down.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a Python algorithm that keeps asking the user for swim times (in
seconds) until the user types -1. Your program will print the following values
(in order, one per line):

  * Average time
  * Range (i.e., the difference between the min and max time)
  * Standard Deviation (hint: like many things in Python you can find how to accomplish this with a quick web search, stdev() should show up on top)

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Allow the user to enter names one at a time until they type the word 'END'
(without quotes). This keyword is called a  **sentinel value,**  and it marks
the end of the input. The user entered names (not counting 'END') are to be
stored in a Python list. The user will enter the names one at a time. After
entering all the names, your algorithm will print the names in the reverse
order that they were entered.

**HINTS:**

  * Remember that the range() function can have up to 3 parameters. The first is the starting value, the second is the ending value, and the third is the increment amount.
  * Don't forget that the index of a list starts at 0, and goes to the length of the list - 1. For example, a list with 5 elements has indices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  * To get the length of a list, use the `len()` function

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** Write a Python algorithm that asks the users for two ASCII characters
(e.g., 'a', 'z'), and prints all of the characters between them (inclusive).

  * If the first character has a lower ASCII value than the second (e.g., 'a' - 'z'), print out the letters in ascending order.
  * Alternatively, if the second letter has a lower ASCII value, print out the letters in descending order.



**HINTS:**

  * Use the `ord()` function to convert a character into an integer:  
`ord('a')` returns 141  
  

  * Use the `chr()` function to convert an integer back into a character:  
`chr(142)` returns 'b'

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** Write a Python algorithm that prints all the coordinates in a coordinate
plane, given two corners. Your program should get four inputs from the user:

  * the starting x-coordinate,
  * the ending x-coordinate,
  * the starting y-coordinate, and
  * the ending y-coordinate.

Your program will then print out all of the coordinates in x y order
(separating coordinates with a space), listing all of the coordinates in the
x-axis before incrementing y. You may assume that the ending coordinate is
never less than the starting coordinate.  

For example, your algorithm would print out:  
1 2  
2 2  
3 2  
4 2  
5 2  
6 2  
1 3

COVID-19 . . . yay).

director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it

value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.

**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.

**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a dataset called `afpft_v2.csv` that describes how
various Air Force personnel performed on their most recent fitness test. Do
NOT ask the user for the file name--just open and read this specific file.
Here is a typical line from the dataset (each line ends with the newline ""\n""
character):



`38, 52, 29, 568`



Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element,"" or ""column."" The following table shows how the above line can be
interpreted:  
  

  | Sit Ups  
(Reps) | Push Ups  
(Reps) | Waist  
(inches) | 1.5 Mile Run Time  
(seconds)  
---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 45 | 65 | 32 | 630  
  


**Write a Python program that analyzes this file and prints the # of
_unsatisfactory_ (less than 75) scores. **



To assist you, we have provided you with a module called `fitness_calculator`
that contains four functions:

  * calculate_waist_score
  * calculate_pushup_score
  * calculate_situp_score
  * calculate_run_score



Each function takes a single number as a parameter, and **returns** the score
for that category. For example, to get the score for an Airman who did 45
pushups, you could import the module and call it, as follows:

    
    
    pushup_score = fitness_calculator.calculate_pushup_score(45)



To get a single Airman's total score, simply calculate the score for each
category and add them up.

    
    
    score = waist_score + pushup_score + situp_score + run_score



**EXAMPLES:**

If, for example, the number of unsatisfactory scores is 10, your program
should print:

    
    
    **10**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have a personal woodshop and want to easily calculate whether you can
afford the board materials for a project. It is unlikely you can obtain the
exact amount of board materials that you may need for the project because wood
planks are provided in fixed lengths.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The total length of board materials required for the project
    * The budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The number of boards needed for the project (Hint: use math.ceil(VALUE) to round up to the next full board).
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of boards is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.



Assume your local lumberyard sells each board in **5.33** feet pieces at
**$45.25** per board. You may assume that all inputs are non-negative numbers.

Recreational SCUBA divers have to plan out how many air tanks they will need
in order to safely dive. The amount varies per diver because each person
consumes air at a different rate. This rate is commonly called Surface Air
Consumption. You want to figure whether you can afford the air requirements

Problem description:
**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

consumes air at a different rate. This rate is commonly called Surface Air
Consumption. You want to figure whether you can afford the air requirements
for the trips that you are planning.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The total dive time for the trip in minutes 
    * The air budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The number of liters needed for the project.
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of compressed air is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.



Assume that your Surface Air Consumption is **14.5** liters/minute, and that
air costs **2 cents** per liter. You may assume that all inputs are non-
negative numbers.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Fuel in the military is essential to conducting operations. Balancing mission
requirements against budgetary constraints is a constant concern.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The distance to a target in miles
    * The budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The amount of fuel (in gallons) needed to reach the target
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of fuel is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.

Assume that the convoy can get **  12.5** miles to the gallon, and that the
current price of fuel is  **$3.73**  per gallon. You may assume that all
inputs are non-negative numbers.



**EXAMPLES:**

  | Example 1 | Example 2

Write an algorithm that gets a decimal GPA, APA, and MPA from the user (in
that order). You may assume that all inputs are non-negative whole numbers.

It then reports which meritorious list the cadet is on. If the GPA is equal to
or above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Dean's List"", and if the APA is equal to or
above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Athletic Director's List"", and if the MPA is
equal to or above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Commandant's List"". Finally, if
the cadet qualifies for all three individual lists, then the cadet is on the
""Superintendent's List"". The algorithm should report all the lists the cadet
is on (in the order defined above), unless the cadet is on the Superintendents
List, in which case, it should report only, ""Superintendent's List"".

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

The basic unit of computer memory is a bit. A bit can represent two values (on
or off, 0 or 1). To represent more information, bits are grouped together in
larger quantities. Beyond a bit, the next logical grouping is a byte, where 1
byte has 8 bits. Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits
and then outputs the equivalent number of bytes.

**EXAMPLE:**

Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---  
Input | 8 | 800 | 7234  
Output | 1.0 | 100.0 | 904.25

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---

Output | 8 | 256 | 16777216

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity  | Name |  Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC  | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the least popular and working up.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a Python program with the definition of a new function named fastest_car
and takes two lists of car info as parameters. The function will then
**return** the car model name with the higher top speed or ""Same speed"" if the
top speeds are the same.

The two parameters to the function are both a list with the same 3 types of
elements, as follows:

  
| **Car Model** | **Cost** | **Top Speed**  
---|---|---|---  
**Value** | Ford Mustang | 27205.00 | 163  
  


| **Car Model** | **Cost** | **Top Speed**  
---|---|---|---  
**Value** | Chevy Corvette | 66400.00 | 194  
  


**EXAMPLE** :

| **Example**  
---|---  
**Input Parameters to** `fastest_car()` |

`fastest_car([""Ford Mustang"", 27205.00, 163], [""Chevy Corvette"", 66400.00,
194])`

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** Write a Python algorithm that asks the users for two ASCII characters
(e.g., 'a', 'z'), and prints all of the characters between them (inclusive).

  * If the first character has a lower ASCII value than the second (e.g., 'a' - 'z'), print out the letters in ascending order.
  * Alternatively, if the second letter has a lower ASCII value, print out the letters in descending order.



**HINTS:**

  * Use the `ord()` function to convert a character into an integer:  
`ord('a')` returns 141  
  

  * Use the `chr()` function to convert an integer back into a character:  
`chr(142)` returns 'b'

**PROBLEM NAME:  
** IterLogic1_dvc



**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.



**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.



**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a program that asks the user to type the name of a file (e.g.,
""file.txt""), and a letter. Your program should then open the file, and print
out all of the lines where the first character starts with the letter

For example, if the user types the following filename:

    
    
    input1.txt
    a
    

and the contents of input1.txt are:

    
    
    aspiration
    classified
    federation
    

the output should be:

    
    
    aspiration
    



Notes:

  * Each line ends with the '\n' character. Use `split()` to get each line.
  * Refer to the String Functions slide to see how you can get the first character from a string
