**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You've been asked to develop a tool to help identify the uniform of the day,
based on temperature and wind speed.

The command center has provided the following table for guidance:

| Temperature  
---|---  
Wind Speed |  | <40 | 40 | >40 and <60 | 60 | >60  
<15 | Parkas | A-Jackets | A-Jackets | A-Jackets | Blues  
15 | ABUs | ABUs | Parkas | Parkas | Blues  
>15 | ABUs | ABUs | Parkas | Parkas | A-Jackets  
  
Create a Python program that first gets the temperature (in degrees
Fahrenheit) and then the wind speed (in knots) from the user. You may assume
that all inputs are non-negative numbers.

It should then output the correct response, as described above.

It then reports which meritorious list the cadet is on. If the GPA is equal to
or above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Dean's List"", and if the APA is equal to or
above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Athletic Director's List"", and if the MPA is
equal to or above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Commandant's List"". Finally, if
the cadet qualifies for all three individual lists, then the cadet is on the
""Superintendent's List"". The algorithm should report all the lists the cadet
is on (in the order defined above), unless the cadet is on the Superintendents
List, in which case, it should report only, ""Superintendent's List"".

14,16,lsn8_fuel,2,lab,0,"Bellow is a problem statement, write a program in Python that solves the problem.Put your code solution within fenced code blocks, and do not provide explanations for your solution. 
**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write an algorithm that gets a fuel load (in lbs) and then a distance to base
(in nautical miles). You may assume all inputs are non-negative numbers.

It then outputs what kind of action the pilot should take. If the fuel load is
less than 50 lbs and the distance to base is less than 70 nm, report ""Return
to base"", otherwise, report ""Resume flight"".

**EXAMPLES:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3 | Example 4  
---|---|---|---|---  
Input | 30  
60 | 60  
60 | 40  
80 | 60  
80  
Output | Return to base | Resume flight | Resume flight | Resume flight  
  
**Note: Output must match exactly.**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a python program that can calculate the range of a projectile when fired
from an artillery on level ground. Your program will ask the user to input the
initial velocity (`v`) and angle in degrees (`theta`). Your program should
then calculate and print the range using the following formula:

`range = (v^2 * sin(2 * theta)) / 9.8`  
 **WARNING: The above formula is not valid Python.**

Output | 65306.122 | 31813.178 | 8350.235  
  
**Hints**

  * You need to use the `math` module's trig functions to solve this problem. Type `import math` at the top of your code to add it to your program.
  * The `sin()` and `cos()` functions assume that the angle is in  **radians**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

One byte is comprised of 8 bits. A typical computer program has a requirement
for much more memory. Therefore, many bytes can be grouped together to make
larger memory amounts. Our convention is for computer memory is scaled in
logical increments of 210 = 1024.

For example:

  * 1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte (KB)
  * 1024 KB = 1 megabyte (MB)
  * 1024 MB = 1 gigabyte (GB)

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

The basic unit of computer memory is a bit. A bit can represent two values (on
or off, 0 or 1). To represent more information, bits are grouped together in
larger quantities. Beyond a bit, the next logical grouping is a byte, where 1
byte has 8 bits. Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits
and then outputs the equivalent number of bytes.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---  
Input | 8 | 800 | 7234  
Output | 1.0 | 100.0 | 904.25

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---  
Input | 3 | 8 | 24  
Output | 8 | 256 | 16777216

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You have been provided with a file called oscar_age_male.csv, which contains
information about male oscar award winners from the 1920s to 2015. Here is a
typical line from the file:

    
    
    1928,44,Emil Jannings,The Last Command

As always, each data element corresponds to a different piece of information.
Here is a table that describes how to interpret each column:

**Year** | **Actor Age** | **Name** | **Film**  
---|---|---|---  
1928 | 44 | Emil Jannings | The Last Command  
  


Write a Python program that reads this file, and gets the following inputs
from the user:

  *     * A start year
    * An end year

Your program should output the age of the youngest actor during that time span
(including the start and end years), as well as the names of all actors that
are within 5 years (inclusive) of the youngest age. For simplicity's sake,
don't try to calculate the current age of the actors; just go with what is in
the file.



For example, if the youngest actor is 25, and the names of the actors within 5
years of the youngest age are Bob and Tom, your program should output:  
  
25  
Bob  
Tom

Boyle's Law states, for an ideal gas, that the pressure (p) multiplied by #
the volume of a container (v) is always constant. So, if we have an initial

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

In Star Trek, starships travel across interstellar space at many times the
speed of light.  Due to the immense speeds involved, velocity in Star Trek is
described using a fictitious unit of measurement known as a ""Warp Factor"".
For reference, Warp Factor 1.0 is equivalent to the speed of light, whereas
Warp Factor 9.0 is more than 700 times faster!

Write a program that asks the user for the number of starships to analyze, as
well as a target distance in light years.  Your program will then get the name
of each starship (e.g., ""USS Enterprise) as well as its maximum cruise speed
(e.g., 9.6), in that order.

Your program will then output the following:

  * The number of days it would take for the fastest starship to travel the target distance
  * The names of all ships that can travel the same distance within 7 days (inclusive) of the fastest time



**HINT:   We have provided you with a function called calculate_travel_time,
which takes a warp factor and distance as parameters, and returns the number
of days it would take to travel that distance.  Call this function to solve
the problem.**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a Python program that keeps asking the user for positive integers until
the user types -1.

Your program will then output the following:

  * # of even numbers
  * Average of all the even numbers (if no even numbers were input, print 0)
  * # of odd numbers
  * Average of all the odd numbers (if no odd numbers were input, print 0)

You may assume that the user will type AT LEAST one number. You cannot assume,
however, that the user will enter both an odd and even number.



HINT:  
Use the mod function to determine if a number is even or odd  
  
print(5 % 2) will print ""1"" because there is a remainder of 1 when you divide
5 by 2

print(4 % 2) will print ""0"" because there is no remainder when you divide 4 by
2

Most importantly, make sure you label your axes, give your charts a title, use
color, etc.

Now that you are a Freshman at USAFA, it might be interesting to learn about
how many years men and women spend in school in different countries. In the
problem, we have provided you with a dataset called `education.csv` that
contains information from various countries about years spent in education.
Here is a typical line from the file:



`Zimbabwe,2010,M,15,64,8.04,5.92,2.09,0.03,3926`



Each position in the line represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key
for your reference:

Country | Year | Gender | Start Age | End Age | Total Years in School |
Primary School | Secondary School | Tertiary School | Population (thousands)  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Zimbabwe | 2010 | M | 15 | 64 | 8.04 | 5.92 | 2.09 | 0.03 | 3926  
  


  
Write a Python program that asks the user for the name of country (e.g.,
""Zimbabwe""), followed by a Gender (""M"" or ""F""). Your program should print the
average number of years that gender spends in school followed by the years
that are greater than or equal to the average.

  
For example, if ""Zimbabwe"" and ""M"" were entered as the country and gender of
interest, respectively, then your program should print out:

You are writing a program to determine which aircraft  can fly in formation
based on their (min) safe cruise speed. Write a python program  
that asks the user for:

  1. The number of aircraft to analyze
  2. The target cruise velocity, in mph



Your program will then repeatedly ask the user for the designator for each
aircraft and its cruise velocity. Once all of the values have been input, your
program will output:

  1. The NUMBER of aircraft whose cruise velocity is within 50mph of the target (above or below, inclusive)
  2. The designator of each aircraft that meets the above criteria

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write an algorithm that asks the user for X and Y coordinates of a single
point (the coordinates of the top left point on the triangle), the length of
the base, and the height of a right triangle. Then, open a graphics window and
draw the triangle. The area of the triangle is should be displayed at the
bottom center of the window in black.



**HINTS:**

  * Make sure you get the user input BEFORE you open the window. Otherwise, the program will freeze.
  * The `draw_text` function will draw text on a screen. Don't worry about getting the text EXACTLY in the center (it's hard!).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity | Name | Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the most popular and working down.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

out the X most popular names, starting with the most popular and working down.

For example, if the user types `5`, and you determine that the five most
popular names are Adrian, David, Bob, Jane, Ulysses, your program should
output:  
Adrian  
David  
Bob  
Jane  
Ulysses  
  

**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * For this lab, you need to sort the list in descending order, so that the most popular items appear first. To do this, you need to tell the function to sort in reverse. You can do this by typing the following (assuming your list is named `my_list`):  
`my_list.sort(reverse=True)`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

Write a Python algorithm that opens the file and outputs the lowest traffic

For example, if the min value is 500, and the roads within 2500 of this value
are ""Road A"", ""Road B"", ""Road C"", then your program should output:

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** In, Python, write an algorithm that first asks the user how many football
players they wish to enter statistics for and then gets that many yearly
passing totals for each player. Output how many of those players that had more
than 5000 passing yards in a year. Also your algorithm will output the average
yardage per year as well as the minimum yardage entered, in that order. You
can assume there is at least one player's yardage to input.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

The Air Academy Federal Credit Union wants to identify its best customers and
comes to you for help. To help with the accounting, create a Python program
which inputs repeated pairs of member last-names followed by account balances
until the word "" **DONE** "" (all capital letters) is entered at the member
last-name prompt.

Your program should output:

  * The last name of the member the highest account value, if there are two members with the same highest account value it should output the name of the first person entered.
  * It will then output the percentage members who are within $10,000 (inclusive) of the highest account value.

There is no bound on the number of members that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one member and balance entered.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You have been asked by your unit to record 100m dash times for an upcoming
USAFA track meet. Create a Python algorithm that first asks for the number of
cadets, and then asks for that many cadet last names, squadrons, and 100m dash
times (in that order).

Your program should output:

  * The cadet squadron containing the cadet with the fastest 100m dash time followed by their 100m dash time. If there is a tie for fastest 100m dash times, you should output the squadron number and time for the LAST cadet entered who had that fastest time.
  * The number of cadets whose 100m dash time was faster than the average.

There is no bound on the number of cadet that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one cadet and track time entered.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Allow the user to enter names one at a time until they type the word 'END'
(without quotes). This keyword is called a  **sentinel value,**  and it marks
the end of the input. The user entered names (not counting 'END') are to be
stored in a Python list. The user will enter the names one at a time. After
entering all the names, your algorithm will print the names in the reverse
order that they were entered.



  | Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---  
Inputs | Adrian  
Liam  
Michelle  
END | Rick  
Morty  
END | Spock  
Data  
Dax  
Burnham  
END  
Outputs | Michelle

You may assume that the user types at least one name.



**HINTS:**

  * Remember that the range() function can have up to 3 parameters. The first is the starting value, the second is the ending value, and the third is the increment amount.
  * Don't forget that the index of a list starts at 0, and goes to the length of the list - 1. For example, a list with 5 elements has indices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  * To get the length of a list, use the `len()` function

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a Python algorithm that asks the user for the number of names to
process, and then gets that many values. Print out the names in alphabetical
order, with each name starting on a line.

  | Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---

You may assume that the user will enter at least one name.



**NOTES:**

  * Python has a built-in function called `sort()` that can be used to sort a list. Here is an example to show you how to use it:  
`# Declare a list and put some stuff in it`  
`my_list = ['b', 'c', 'a', 'd']`  
  
`# Sort the list alphabetically (a-z)`  
`my_list.sort()`

interpreted:

  | Day | Gas Type | Price (in Dollars)  
---|---|---|---

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a program that asks the user to type the name of a file (e.g.,
""file.txt""), and a letter. Your program should then open the file, and print
out all of the lines where the first character starts with the letter

For example, if the user types the following filename:

    
    
    input1.txt
    a
    

and the contents of input1.txt are:

    
    
    aspiration
    classified
    federation
    

the output should be:

    
    
    aspiration
    



Notes:

  * Each line ends with the '\n' character. Use `split()` to get each line.
  * Refer to the String Functions slide to see how you can get the first character from a string

104,114,lsn14_coordinates,2,lab,0,"Bellow is a problem statement, write a program in Python that solves the problem.Put your code solution within fenced code blocks, and do not provide explanations for your solution. 
**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** Write a Python algorithm that prints all the coordinates in a coordinate
plane, given two corners. Your program should get four inputs from the user:

  * the starting x-coordinate,
  * the ending x-coordinate,
  * the starting y-coordinate, and
  * the ending y-coordinate.

Your program will then print out all of the coordinates in x y order
(separating coordinates with a space), listing all of the coordinates in the
x-axis before incrementing y. You may assume that the ending coordinate is
never less than the starting coordinate.  

For example, your algorithm would print out:  
1 2  
2 2  
3 2  
4 2  
5 2  
6 2  
1 3  
2 3  
3 3  
4 3  
5 3  
6 3  
. . . and so on



**HINTS:**

  * Write a loop that first prints all of the x coordinates from start to end
  * Use a nested loop to print all of the y coordinates from start to end

Explanation: 
1. In the original code, the range used in the for loop was incorrect. The start value should be 10 (the power of 2 of 1024) and the end value should be -1 (the power of 2 of 1), and the step should be -1 to decrement the power of 2.
2. By using the corrected range, the loop will go from 10 to 0, inclusive, and the calculation of the power_of_2 using 2 raised to the power of i will give the correct values.
3. The correct powers of 2 from 1024 to 1 will then be printed.",completed,0.0,"INCORRECT.  Expected the following:

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.

**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

- Inside the loop, we prompt the user to enter the cargo capacity and store it in the variable `cargo_capacity`.
- We check if the `cargo_capacity` is less than the current minimum capacity. If it is, we update the minimum capacity.
- We check if the `cargo_capacity` is greater than the current maximum capacity. If it is, we update the maximum capacity.
- We check if the `cargo_capacity` is greater than or equal to 10000. If it is, we increment the count variable.
- After the loop ends, we print the minimum capacity, maximum capacity, and the number of aircraft that can carry at least 10000 lbs.",completed,0.0,"Min Value is Incorrect.  Expected 3000

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a dataset called `afpft_v2.csv` that describes how
various Air Force personnel performed on their most recent fitness test. Do
NOT ask the user for the file name--just open and read this specific file.
Here is a typical line from the dataset (each line ends with the newline ""\n""
character):



`38, 52, 29, 568`



Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element,"" or ""column."" The following table shows how the above line can be
interpreted:  
  

  | Sit Ups  
(Reps) | Push Ups  
(Reps) | Waist  
(inches) | 1.5 Mile Run Time  
(seconds)  
---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 45 | 65 | 32 | 630  
  


**Write a Python program that analyzes this file and prints the # of
_unsatisfactory_ (less than 75) scores. **



To assist you, we have provided you with a module called `fitness_calculator`
that contains four functions:

  * calculate_waist_score
  * calculate_pushup_score
  * calculate_situp_score
  * calculate_run_score



Each function takes a single number as a parameter, and **returns** the score
for that category. For example, to get the score for an Airman who did 45
pushups, you could import the module and call it, as follows:

    
    
    pushup_score = fitness_calculator.calculate_pushup_score(45)



To get a single Airman's total score, simply calculate the score for each
category and add them up.

    
    
    score = waist_score + pushup_score + situp_score + run_score



**EXAMPLES:**

If, for example, the number of unsatisfactory scores is 10, your program
should print:

    
    
    **10**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You have been asked to write a program to assess student's performance on the
AFT. Write a Python program that asks the user to repeatedly type in the name
of a cadet, followed by their run time (in whole seconds) until the user types
the word ""DONE"". Your program then analyze the values and print:

  * The fastest (lowest) AFT time.
  * The names of all cadets who were within 30 seconds of the fastest time. 
    * Comparison to the target time should be exclusive.
    * Names should be output in the same order as input

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a Python function that calculates the area of a trapazoid. You will name
your function `calculate_area`, and it will have the following parameters (in
this order):

  * Side_A
  * Side_B
  * Height

Our function will  **return**  the area, which can be computed using the
following equation:

A = (a + b) h

NOTE: You do NOT need to call the function.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** You have been asked to write a program that analyzes the results acquired
from several flight tests executed last week. Write a program that gets from
the user the number flight tests preformed, and gets the result from each
flight (which you may assume are whole numbers) from the user. Your program
must print out:

  * The average result for the flight tests.
  * The count of flight tests that scored below the average.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** You have been provided with a table that describes a simple night sky. In
this code, a list (`simple_map`) is populated with characters representing the
location of various astronomical entities (stars, planets, etc).



    
    
    S = Star; St = Satellite; M = Moon; P = Planet; C = Comet; _ = No Major Feature



Write a program that gets two values from the user in the following order:

1) a row, a 1 indicates the Top row and 8 the Bottom row

2) a column, a 1 indicates the Leftmost column and 8 the Rightmost column



Finally, **Print** out the contents of the table at that particular cell.



**HINT:**

  * Your output should be one of the following letters: ""S"", ""St"", ""M"", ""P"", ""C"", or ""_""

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You are writing a program that will determine whether or not a fighter pilot
will need to make an evasive action when enemy aircraft are near. Your program
will ask for the number of enemy planes in the area. It will then ask for the
distance between the pilot and each of the enemy planes (in miles, which do
not have to be whole numbers). Your program will keep track of how many enemy
planes are within 20 miles of the pilot (inclusive). Your program will then
print one of the following statements:

**# of Enemy Planes in Area** | **0** | **1-2** | **> 2**  
---|---|---|---  
**Output** | All Clear | Warning | Evasive Action

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

C-130 Pilot qualifications usually depend on a pilot's flight experience in
terms of flight hours.

**C-130 Pilot Qualification** | **Flight Hours**  
---|---  
Upgrade Pilot | 600  
Aircraft Commander | 800  
Formation Lead | 1000  
Instructor Pilot | 1250  
Evaluator Pilot | 1500  
  
  
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter the number of flight hours
they currently have (does not need to be a whole number). Then, referencing
the table above, print out all qualifications they should have achieved in the
aircraft (one per line). If the their experience in the C-130 is more than 600
flight hours, output ""Co-Pilot"".

**Output** |

Upgrade Pilot  
Aircraft Commander  
Formation Lead  
Instructor Pilot  
Evaluator Pilot

|

Upgrade Pilot  
Aircraft Commander  
Formation Lead

| Co-Pilot

in range are printed.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

According to intelligence reports, the North Korean military uses at least 5
different classes of Ballistic Missiles. The names of these missiles, as well
as their maximum theoretical range, are provided below:

**Missile Class** | **Maximum Range (inclusive, in Kilometers)**  
---|---  
Hwasong-6 | 500  
KN-11 | 1200  
Musudan BM-25 | 4000  
Hwasong-14 | 8000  
Taepodong-2 | 12000  
  
  
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter the distance to a potential
target (in Kilometers). Then, referencing the table, print out all of the
Missile Classes that could potentially reach the target (one per line). If no
missiles are in range, output ""Not in range"".



**EXAMPLES:**

  | **Example 1** | **Example 2** | **Example 3**  
---|---|---|---  
**Input** | 1800 | 8000 | 18000  
**Output** | Musudan BM-25  
Hwason-14  
Taepodong-2 |

Hwasong-14  
Taepodong-2

| Not in range  
  
NOTE: The missiles can be listed in any order, so long as only the ones in
range are printed.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Assume someone takes hundreds of photos on their smartphone every week. They
are seeking the best and least expensive alternatives to store/share their
images because their phone's storage capacity is limited. Using the table
below, determine which storage options they should consider, assuming each
image has an average file size of 6 MB.



**Storage Option** | **Short Name** | **Number of Images (inclusive)**  
---|---|---  
CD-ROM (700 MB) | CD | 116  
DVD-ROM (4.7 GB) | DVD | 780  
USB Thumb Drive (16 GB) | USB Small | 2660  
USB Thumb Drive (64 GB) | USB Large | 10600  
Portable Hard Drive (256 GB) | Portable HDD | 42600  
  
  
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter the number of images that
need to be shared/stored (non-negative, whole number). Then, referencing the
table above, print out all the storage options (by Short Name) capable of
holding that many images (one per line). If no storage options are capable of
storing that many images, output ""Consider Cloud Storage"".



**EXAMPLES:**

  | **Example 1** | **Example 2** | **Example 3**  
---|---|---|---  
**Input** | 2000 | 4000 | 45000  
**Output** | USB Small  
USB Large

202,227,a1_7_broadband,2,lab,1,"Bellow is a problem statement, write a program in Python that solves the problem.Put your code solution within fenced code blocks, and do not provide explanations for your solution. 


**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Choosing the right broadband speed for your internet connection depends on
which online activities you plan on engaging while online. Using the table
below, determine which activities are possible with a given broadband speed,
given in Kilobits per second (Kbps).



**Activity** | **Short Name** | **Minimum Broadband Speed  
(inclusive, in Kbps)**  
---|---|---  
Social Media | Social Media | 1000  
Multiplayer Gaming | Gaming | 4000  
HD Video Conferencing | Video Conferencing | 6000  
File Downloading | File Downloads | 10000  
Stream Ultra HD 4K Video | HD 4K Video | 25000  
  
  
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter the broadband speed in
Kbps. Then, referencing the table above, print out all the activities (by
Short Name) that can be achieved using that speed (one per line). If the
broadband speed is less than 1000 Kbps, output ""Upgrade to Broadband"".



**EXAMPLES:**

  | **Example 1** | **Example 2** | **Example 3**  
---|---|---|---  
**Input** | 8500 | 5000 | 750  
**Output** |

Social Media  
Gaming  
Video Conferencing

|

Social Media  
Gaming

| Upgrade to Broadband  
  
NOTE: The activities can be listed in any order, so long as only the ones in
range are printed.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have a personal woodshop and want to easily calculate whether you can
afford the board materials for a project. It is unlikely you can obtain the
exact amount of board materials that you may need for the project because wood
planks are provided in fixed lengths.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The total length of board materials required for the project
    * The budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The number of boards needed for the project (Hint: use math.ceil(VALUE) to round up to the next full board).
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of boards is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.



Assume your local lumberyard sells each board in **5.33** feet pieces at
**$45.25** per board. You may assume that all inputs are non-negative numbers.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Recreational SCUBA divers have to plan out how many air tanks they will need
in order to safely dive. The amount varies per diver because each person
consumes air at a different rate. This rate is commonly called Surface Air
Consumption. You want to figure whether you can afford the air requirements
for the trips that you are planning.

    * The air budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)

  *     * The number of liters needed for the project.
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of compressed air is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.



Assume that your Surface Air Consumption is **14.5** liters/minute, and that
air costs **2 cents** per liter. You may assume that all inputs are non-
negative numbers.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Fuel in the military is essential to conducting operations. Balancing mission
requirements against budgetary constraints is a constant concern.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The distance to a target in miles
    * The budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The amount of fuel (in gallons) needed to reach the target
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of fuel is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.

Assume that the convoy can get **  12.5** miles to the gallon, and that the
current price of fuel is  **$3.73**  per gallon. You may assume that all
inputs are non-negative numbers.

    * **r**  is the radius of the cylinder
    * **t**  is the total amount of spheres



Store the answer in a variable called **  volume**. You do not need to print
the variable.

The math module contains the mathematical constant, π. To use it, simply type
**math.pi**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You are trying to write a program that calculates the volume of multiple
identical cylinders. The template provided to you defines 3 variables:

  * **radius**  \- radius of the cylinders
  * **height** \- height of the cylinders
  * **total**  \- The total amount of cylinders



Calculate the volume, using the following formula:

V = π r2 h t

Where . . .

  *     * **π**  is the mathematical constant (approximately equal to 3.14... -- see the HINT for more details)
    * **r**  is the radius of the cylinder
    * **h  **is the height of the cylinder
    * **t**  is the total amount of cylinders



Store the answer in a variable called **volume**. You do not need to print the
variable.



**HINT:**

The math module contains the mathematical constant, π. To use it, simply type
**math.pi**

Write the Python code needed to get three values from the user:

  1. A string representing the name of an aircraft (e.g., F-16). Store this value in a variable called  **aircraft_name**
  2. A floating point value representing the maximum speed of the aircraft. Store this value in a variable called  **aircraft_speed**
  3. An integer representing the number of airplanes of this type owned by the USAF. Store this value in a variable called  **quantity**

**IMPORTANT:** Your template file contains a print statement that combines
these values to produce an output (see Example). **Do not modify this line.**
Simply add your input statements in the space provided.

always greater than the first.

Using these start and stop values, print the two following items in order:

**HINT** : Use `range()` to accomplish this. In order to print the result from
range() as a list, surround it with list(), `list(range(#,#))`, like you
surround input() with int() or float(), `int(input())`.

2.  Print the size (how many numbers are contained) of that list

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You are provided a list of PFT scores, already in the lab template, in a
variable `pft_scores` arranged in no particular order.

Write a Python program that obtains a new score from the user. If the score is
valid (above zero and no greater than 500), add it to the list and print out
the following two stats in this order:

1\. **average score  ** HINT: use the functions `len()` and `sum()` on your
list to find the average

2\. **range of scores** , the difference between the largest score and
smallest score. HINT: use the functions `min()` and `max()` on your list to
find the range

If the score is invalid (below zero or above 500), instead print:  ""Invalid
score provided"".



**EXAMPLE:**

| **Example 1** | **Example 2** | **Example 3**  
---|---|---|---  
**Input** | -5 | 328 | 65  
**Outputs** | Invalid score provided |

Write an algorithm that asks the user for X and Y coordinates of a single
point (the coordinates of the top left point on the triangle), the length of
the base, and the height of a right triangle. Then, open a graphics window and
draw the triangle. The area of the triangle is should be displayed at the
bottom center of the window in black.



**HINTS:**

  * Make sure you get the user input BEFORE you open the window. Otherwise, the program will freeze.
  * The `draw_text` function will draw text on a screen. Don't worry about getting the text EXACTLY in the center (it's hard!).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

**IMPORTANT:  
** You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you
test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you
can comment out your test code).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a Python program that already contains code to get
the following two items from the user:

  * **the_string** :  A pipe-separated string.  
Example: johnson81|4081|30no86|cj4081|Craig|Johnson|Depot|London

  * **column_to_print** :  A number indicating which item from the input string to print  
NOTE:  0 indicates the first item in the string, 1 indicates the second, etc.

Add code to this program that:

  1. Splits the the_string into separate items.
  2. Prints the number of items that result from splitting the_string (not the number of characters in the string).
  3. Prints the item indicated by the column_to_print value.

**EXAMPLE:**

If the user types:

    
    
    johnson81|4081|30no86|cj4081|Craig|Johnson|Depot|London  
    2

Your program should output:

    
    
    8  
    30no86

as the backslash ('\').** **If you cannot find it, ask an instructor for
help.**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a Python program that already contains code to get
the following two items from the user:

  * **the_string** :  A hyphen-separated string.  
Example: johnson81-4081-30no86-cj4081-Craig-Johnson-Depot-London

  * **column_to_print** :  A number indicating which item from the string to print.  
NOTE:  0 indicates the first item in the string, 1 indicates the second, etc.

Add code to this program that:

  1. Splits the_string into separate items.
  2. Prints the number of items that result from splitting the_string (not the number of characters in the string).
  3. Prints the item indicated by the column_to_print value.

**EXAMPLE:**

If the user types:

    
    
    johnson81-4081-30no86-cj4081-Craig-Johnson-Depot-London  
    2

Your program should output:

    
    
    8  
    30no86

**HINT: A hyphen (dash) is this: '-'. On most keyboards it is located to the
right of the '0' key.** **If you cannot find it, ask an instructor for help.**

NOTE:  0 indicates the first item in the string, 1 indicates the second, etc.

Add code to this program that:

  1. Splits the_string into separate items.
  2. Prints the number of items that result from splitting the_string (not the number of characters in the string).
  3. Prints the item indicated by the column_to_print value.

The oribt period of a planet can be calculated using the following formula:



`Period = (D * 3.14)/ V`





In this formula:

  * **D**  is the diameter of the orbit path (a floating point number)
  * **V**  is the velocity of the planet (a floating point number)



Write a function called  **orbit_period**  that takes **D**  and **V**  as
parameters (in that order), and  **returns**  the orbit period.  



**NOTES:**

  * You do NOT need to call this function.  Simply define it.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

C-130 Pilot qualifications usually depend on a pilot's flight experience in
terms of flight hours.

**C-130 Pilot Qualification** | **Flight Hours**  
---|---  
Upgrade Pilot | 600  
Aircraft Commander | 800  
Formation Lead | 1000  
Instructor Pilot | 1250  
Evaluator Pilot | 1500  
  
  
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter the number of flight hours
they currently have (does not need to be a whole number). Then, referencing
the table above, print out all qualifications they should have achieved in the
aircraft (one per line). If the their experience in the C-130 is more than 600
flight hours, output ""Co-Pilot"".



**EXAMPLES:**

  | **Example 1** | **Example 2** | **Example 3**  
---|---|---|---  
**Input** | 1996 | 1156.7 | 535.4  
**Output** |

Upgrade Pilot  
Aircraft Commander  
Formation Lead  
Instructor Pilot  
Evaluator Pilot

Aircraft Commander  
Formation Lead

| Co-Pilot

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Assume someone takes hundreds of photos on their smartphone every week. They
are seeking the best and least expensive alternatives to store/share their
images because their phone's storage capacity is limited. Using the table
below, determine which storage options they should consider, assuming each
image has an average file size of 6 MB.



**Storage Option** | **Short Name** | **Number of Images (inclusive)**  
---|---|---  
CD-ROM (700 MB) | CD | 116  
DVD-ROM (4.7 GB) | DVD | 780  
USB Thumb Drive (16 GB) | USB Small | 2660  
USB Thumb Drive (64 GB) | USB Large | 10600  
Portable Hard Drive (256 GB) | Portable HDD | 42600  
  
  
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter the number of images that
need to be shared/stored (non-negative, whole number). Then, referencing the
table above, print out all the storage options (by Short Name) capable of
holding that many images (one per line). If no storage options are capable of
storing that many images, output ""Consider Cloud Storage"".

def determine_activities(broadband_speed):

broadband_speed = int(input(""Enter the broadband speed in Kbps: ""))
determine_activities(broadband_speed)
```

Explanation: 
1. The function `determine_activities` takes the broadband speed as an argument.
2. If the broadband speed is less than 1000, it prints the message ""Upgrade to Broadband"".
3. Otherwise, it checks the broadband speed against the minimum speeds required for each activity.
4. If the broadband speed meets the minimum requirement for an activity, it prints the corresponding short name of the activity.
5. The program asks the user to enter the broadband speed in Kbps using the `input()` function.
6. The entered speed is converted to an integer using `int()` and then passed to the `determine_activities` function to determine the activities that can be achieved with that speed.",completed,0.0,"------------------------------

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Recreational SCUBA divers have to plan out how many air tanks they will need
in order to safely dive. The amount varies per diver because each person
consumes air at a different rate. This rate is commonly called Surface Air
Consumption. You want to figure whether you can afford the air requirements
for the trips that you are planning.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The total dive time for the trip in minutes 
    * The air budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The number of liters needed for the project.
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of compressed air is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.



Assume that your Surface Air Consumption is **14.5** liters/minute, and that
air costs **2 cents** per liter. You may assume that all inputs are non-
negative numbers.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

A 3D printer converts computer generated models into physical objects by
heating and extruding a filament known as Polylactic Acid (PLA). PLA, normally
sold in spools, is directly fed to the printer head like a thread. You want to
determine if you can afford to 3D print a project given its volume of
material.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The volume of the 3D model to be printed (in cm3)
    * The user's budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The length of material (in meters) needed to produce the object
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of materials is greater than or not greater than the user's budget, respectfully.

Assume that each cm3 requires **  0.312** meters of PLA to print, and that PLA
filament costs  **$0.063**  per meter. You may assume that all inputs are non-
negative numbers.

the paint for the project

Write an algorithm that asks for:

Assume that a gallon of paint covers **15** square feet, and that the current
price of paint is  **$12.23**  per gallon. You may assume that all inputs are
non-negative numbers. You should also assume that you can purchase portions of
gallons of paint so do NOT round up to the nearest full gallon.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Fuel in the military is essential to conducting operations. Balancing mission
requirements against budgetary constraints is a constant concern.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The distance to a target in miles
    * The budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The amount of fuel (in gallons) needed to reach the target
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of fuel is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.

Assume that the convoy can get **  12.5** miles to the gallon, and that the
current price of fuel is  **$3.73**  per gallon. You may assume that all
inputs are non-negative numbers.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** You have been provided with a function: get_value(n). Your task is to call
this function 6 times.

Get a number from the user (`x`), and print the `x` , `x + 1`, `x + 2`, ... `x
+ 5` values that result from calling get_value() with x to x+5  (i.e., you
should print 6 numbers total).



**HINTS:**

  * You should call this function from inside a loop passing a variable that increases by 1 each loop
  * If the user enters a 2, you should call `get_value(2)`, `get_value(3)`, up to `get_value(7)` and print the results of each call (5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15)

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write an algorithm that asks the user for X and Y coordinates of a single
point (the coordinates of the top left point on the triangle), the length of
the base, and the height of a right triangle. Then, open a graphics window and
draw the triangle. The area of the triangle is should be displayed at the
bottom center of the window in black.



**HINTS:**

  * Make sure you get the user input BEFORE you open the window. Otherwise, the program will freeze.
  * The `draw_text` function will draw text on a screen. Don't worry about getting the text EXACTLY in the center (it's hard!).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You've been asked to develop a tool to help identify the uniform of the day,
based on temperature and wind speed.

The command center has provided the following table for guidance:

| Temperature  
---|---  
Wind Speed |  | <40 | 40 | >40 and <60 | 60 | >60  
<15 | Parkas | A-Jackets | A-Jackets | A-Jackets | Blues  
15 | ABUs | ABUs | Parkas | Parkas | Blues  
>15 | ABUs | ABUs | Parkas | Parkas | A-Jackets  
  
Create a Python program that first gets the temperature (in degrees
Fahrenheit) and then the wind speed (in knots) from the user. You may assume
that all inputs are non-negative numbers.

It should then output the correct response, as described above.

Write an algorithm that gets a decimal GPA, APA, and MPA from the user (in
that order). You may assume that all inputs are non-negative whole numbers.

It then reports which meritorious list the cadet is on. If the GPA is equal to
or above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Dean's List"", and if the APA is equal to or
above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Athletic Director's List"", and if the MPA is
equal to or above 3.0, the cadet is on the ""Commandant's List"". Finally, if
the cadet qualifies for all three individual lists, then the cadet is on the
""Superintendent's List"". The algorithm should report all the lists the cadet
is on (in the order defined above), unless the cadet is on the Superintendents
List, in which case, it should report only, ""Superintendent's List"".

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a python program that can calculate the range of a projectile when fired
from an artillery on level ground. Your program will ask the user to input the
initial velocity (`v`) and angle in degrees (`theta`). Your program should
then calculate and print the range using the following formula:

`range = (v^2 * sin(2 * theta)) / 9.8`

**Hints**

  * You need to use the `math` module's trig functions to solve this problem. Type `import math` at the top of your code to add it to your program.
  * The `sin()` and `cos()` functions assume that the angle is in  **radians**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

One byte is comprised of 8 bits. A typical computer program has a requirement
for much more memory. Therefore, many bytes can be grouped together to make
larger memory amounts. Our convention is for computer memory is scaled in
logical increments of 210 = 1024.

For example:

  * 1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte (KB)
  * 1024 KB = 1 megabyte (MB)
  * 1024 MB = 1 gigabyte (GB)

Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and then outputs
the equivalent number of kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes.

larger quantities. Beyond a bit, the next logical grouping is a byte, where 1
byte has 8 bits. Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---

Output | 8 | 256 | 16777216

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** You have been provided with a table that describes a simple night sky as a
2D list in your code template.  This list is an exact mapping to the picture
below.  The 2D list (`star_map`) is populated with characters representing the
locations of various astronomical entities (stars, planets, etc).  For
example, you can see in the template that the very first item is 'M', since
there is a Moon in the top left corner.



Write a program that gets two values from the user in the following order:

  1. The horizontal index of the cell in the star map to search (e.g. 0 for the top row)
  2. The vertical index of the cell in the star map to search (e.g. 0 for the leftmost column)



Finally, **print  ** ****out the word associated with the code in the table at
that particular cell.

`S = Star; St = Satellite; M = Moon; P = Planet; _ = Nothing`

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

**IMPORTANT:  
** You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you
test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you
can comment out your test code).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity  | Name |  Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC  | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the least popular and working up.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Write a Python program that takes two inputs and produces two outputs. NOTE:
This problem does not require creating an additional list to solve.

The inputs from the user are:

  1. A gender, a string which will be MALE or FEMALE
  2. A threshold number for the number of times that a name was used.

Your program will compare the information from the user to the names.csv
dataset, and output two statistics as output:

  1. The count of the number of names that were used above the threshold given for the provided gender
  2. The total count of children with the high usage names and the specified gender. In other words, the sum of the number of children given names above the threshold value from input 2.

For example, if the min traffic count is 500, and the roads within 2500 of
this value are ""Road A"", ""Road B"", ""Road C"", then your program should output:

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This program makes use of the traffic.csv dataset. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`691,6067 North,Kimball Ave,8/15/06,15600,North Bound:7500/South Bound:8100`



  
As you will recall from class, each position in the line (separated by a
comma) represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key for your
reference:

ID | Address | Street | Sample Date | Total # of Passing Vehicles  | # of
Vehicles by Direction  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
691 | 6067 North | Kimball Ave | 8/15/06 | 15600 | North Bound:7500/South
Bound:8100  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that opens the file and outputs the # of roads whose
traffic count is greater than (or equal to) the average.  For example, if you
determine that the answer is 20, your program should output:

    
    
    20

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You are being provided with a simple 2D list that contains the names and
populations of the 10 largest cities in the world. This list (which is called
`cities_table`) can be logicially visualized as the following:



**City** |  **Population**  
---|---  
Tokyo | 37,435,191  
Delhi | 29,399,141  
Shanghai  | 25,647,805  
Sao Paulo  | 21,846,507  
Mexico City  | 21,671,908  
Cairo | 20,484,965  
Dhaka | 20,283,552  
Mumbai | 20,185,064  
Beijing  | 20,035,455  
Osaka | 19,222,665  
  
  
Write a Python program that gets a population from the user, and prints the
names of all the cities whose populations are at least that big (keep the same
order as in the 2D list). Print each city's name on a separate line.

The cadet intercollegiate golf team needs some help tracking individual
performance. Create a Python algorithm that inputs repeated pairs of cadet
last-names followed by the golfers score until the word **END** (all capital
letters) is entered at the member last-name prompt.

Your algorithm should output:

  * The last name of the member with the lowest (best) score, if there are two members with the same lowest score, it should output the last name of the first person entered.
  * The percentage of members who are within 5 strokes (inclusive) of the lowest score.

There is no bound on the number of golfers that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one golfer and score entered.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

The Air Academy Federal Credit Union wants to identify its best customers and
comes to you for help. To help with the accounting, create a Python program
which inputs repeated pairs of member last-names followed by account balances
until the word **DONE** (all capital letters) is entered at the member last-
name prompt.

Your program should output:

  * The last name of the member with the highest account value, if there are two members with the same highest account value it should output the name of the first person entered.
  * It will then output the percentage members who are within $10,000 (inclusive) of the highest account value.

There is no bound on the number of members that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one member and balance entered.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You have been asked by your unit to record 100m dash times for an upcoming
USAFA track meet. Create a Python algorithm that first asks for the number of
cadets, and then asks for that many cadet last names, squadrons, and 100m dash
times (in that order).

Your program should output:

  * The cadet squadron containing the cadet with the fastest 100m dash time followed by their 100m dash time. If there is a tie for fastest 100m dash times, you should output the squadron number and time for the LAST cadet entered who had that fastest time.
  * The number of cadets whose 100m dash time was faster than the average.

There is no bound on the number of cadets that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one cadet and track time entered.

Write a Python program that obtains a new score from the user. If the score is

the following two stats in this order:

1\. **average score  ** HINT: use the functions `len()` and `sum()` on your
list to find the average

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a Python program that obtains two whole numbers that represent the start
and stop values for a range of numbers. You may assume the second number is
always greater than the first.

Using these start and stop values, print the two following items in order:

1.  Print a list that starts at the start value and ends at (the list contains) the stop value

**HINT** : Use `range()` to accomplish this. In order to print the result from
range() as a list, surround it with list(), `list(range(#,#))`, like you
surround input() with int() or float(), `int(input())`.

2.  Print the size (how many numbers are contained) of that list

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a Python program with the definition of a new function named fastest_car
and takes two lists of car info as parameters. The function will then
**return** the car model name with the higher top speed or ""Same speed"" if the
top speeds are the same.

The two parameters to the function are both a list with the same 3 types of
elements, as follows:

  
| **Car Model** | **Cost** | **Top Speed**  
---|---|---|---  
**Value** | Ford Mustang | 27205.00 | 163  
  


| **Car Model** | **Cost** | **Top Speed**  
---|---|---|---  
**Value** | Chevy Corvette | 66400.00 | 194  
  


**EXAMPLE** :

| **Example**  
---|---  
**Input Parameters to** `fastest_car()` |

`fastest_car([""Ford Mustang"", 27205.00, 163], [""Chevy Corvette"", 66400.00,
194])`  
  
**Outputs** | Chevy Corvette

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** Write a Python algorithm that asks the users for two ASCII characters
(e.g., 'a', 'z'), and prints all of the characters between them (inclusive).

  * If the first character has a lower ASCII value than the second (e.g., 'a' - 'z'), print out the letters in ascending order.
  * Alternatively, if the second letter has a lower ASCII value, print out the letters in descending order.



**HINTS:**

  * Use the `ord()` function to convert a character into an integer:  
`ord('a')` returns 141  
  

  * Use the `chr()` function to convert an integer back into a character:  
`chr(142)` returns 'b'

361,549,IterLogic2_coordinates,4,lab,0,"Bellow is a problem statement, write a program in Python that solves the problem.Put your code solution within fenced code blocks, and do not provide explanations for your solution. 


**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** Write a Python algorithm that prints all the coordinates in a coordinate
plane, given two corners. Your program should get four inputs from the user:

  * the starting x-coordinate,
  * the ending x-coordinate,
  * the starting y-coordinate, and
  * the ending y-coordinate.

Your program will then print out all of the coordinates in x y order
(separating coordinates with a space), listing all of the coordinates in the
x-axis before incrementing y. You may assume that the ending coordinate is
never less than the starting coordinate.  

For example, your algorithm would print out:  
1 2  
2 2  
3 2  
4 2  
5 2  
6 2  
1 3  
2 3  
3 3  
4 3  
5 3  
6 3  
. . . and so on



**HINTS:**

  * Write a loop that first prints all of the x coordinates from start to end
  * Use a nested loop to print all of the y coordinates from start to end

**PROBLEM NAME:  
** IterLogic1_dvc



**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.



**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a program that asks the user to type the name of a file (e.g.,
""file.txt""), and a letter. Your program should then open the file, and print
out all of the lines where the first character starts with the letter

For example, if the user types the following filename:

    
    
    input1.txt
    a
    

and the contents of input1.txt are:

    
    
    aspiration
    classified
    federation
    

the output should be:

    
    
    aspiration
    



Notes:

  * Each line ends with the '\n' character. Use `split()` to get each line.
  * Refer to the String Functions slide to see how you can get the first character from a string

378,237,a1_4_arrow,2,skill,1,"Bellow is a problem statement, write a program in Python that solves the problem.Put your code solution within fenced code blocks, and do not provide explanations for your solution. 
**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a partially complete Python program that contains
2 variables.

  1. arrow_height (input by the user in feet)
  2. apple_height (already initialized in feet)



Add code to the end of this program that will output:

  *     *         Arrow too high 

If the arrow height is higher than the apple  
  

    *         Direct hit

If the arrow height is equal to the apple  
  

    *         Arrow too low 

If the arrow is lower than the apple  
  



**EXAMPLES:**



  | **Example 1** | **Example 2** | **Example 3**  
---|---|---|---
