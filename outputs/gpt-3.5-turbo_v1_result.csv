Women: Calories = ( (Age x 0.074) -- (Weight x 0.05741) + (Heart Rate x
0.4472) -- 20.4022 ) x Time / 4.184

Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats
per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output calories burned for men
and women.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

One byte is comprised of 8 bits. A typical computer program has a requirement
for much more memory. Therefore, many bytes can be grouped together to make
larger memory amounts. Our convention is for computer memory is scaled in
logical increments of 210 = 1024.

For example:

  * 1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte (KB)
  * 1024 KB = 1 megabyte (MB)
  * 1024 MB = 1 gigabyte (GB)

Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and then outputs
the equivalent number of kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

The basic unit of computer memory is a bit. A bit can represent two values (on
or off, 0 or 1). To represent more information, bits are grouped together in
larger quantities. Beyond a bit, the next logical grouping is a byte, where 1
byte has 8 bits. Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits
and then outputs the equivalent number of bytes.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** In this lab, you are being given the freedom to explore `matplotlib`'s
plotting capabilities.

The template ZIP file contains several interesting datasets that we have
collected from the internet (although you are free to include any other
dataset if you wish). Examine these datasets, and generate at least 2
""interesting"" graphs. Each plot should use a different dataset. Additionally,
each plot must be a different type (line and pie graph, etc)

Use the `subplot` feature to make sure all of the graphs fit on one screen.
Most importantly, make sure you label your axes, give your charts a title, use
color, etc.

  
**HINT**

  * Use numpy's `genfromtxt` function to read the values in the file. If you forget how to use this function, refer to the lecture video.

how many years men and women spend in school in different countries. In the
problem, we have provided you with a dataset called `education.csv` that
contains information from various countries about years spent in education.
Here is a typical line from the file:



`Zimbabwe,2010,M,15,64,8.04,5.92,2.09,0.03,3926`



Each position in the line represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key
for your reference:

Country | Year | Gender | Start Age | End Age | Total Years in School |
Primary School | Secondary School | Tertiary School | Population (thousands)  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

""Zimbabwe""), followed by a Gender (""M"" or ""F""). Your program should print the
average number of years that gender spends in school followed by the years
that are greater than or equal to the average.

1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`

---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the most popular and working down.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two

which inputs repeated pairs of member last-names followed by account balances
until the word "" **DONE** "" (all capital letters) is entered at the member
last-name prompt.

Your program should output:

  * The last name of the member the highest account value, if there are two members with the same highest account value it should output the name of the first person entered.
  * It will then output the percentage members who are within $10,000 (inclusive) of the highest account value.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.

**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**

is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

**IMPORTANT:  
** You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you
test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you
can comment out your test code).


","
import math

def detect_collision(ship_x, ship_y, ship_radius, asteroid_x, asteroid_y, asteroid_radius):
    distance = math.sqrt((ship_x - asteroid_x)**2 + (ship_y - asteroid_y)**2)
    
    if distance <= ship_radius + asteroid_radius:
        return True
    else:
        return False

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a dataset called `afpft_v2.csv` that describes how
various Air Force personnel performed on their most recent fitness test. Do
NOT ask the user for the file name--just open and read this specific file.
Here is a typical line from the dataset (each line ends with the newline ""\n""
character):



`38, 52, 29, 568`



Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element,"" or ""column."" The following table shows how the above line can be
interpreted:  
  

  | Sit Ups  
(Reps) | Push Ups  
(Reps) | Waist  
(inches) | 1.5 Mile Run Time  
(seconds)  
---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 45 | 65 | 32 | 630  
  


**Write a Python program that analyzes this file and prints the # of
_unsatisfactory_ (less than 75) scores. **



To assist you, we have provided you with a module called `fitness_calculator`
that contains four functions:

  * calculate_waist_score
  * calculate_pushup_score
  * calculate_situp_score
  * calculate_run_score



Each function takes a single number as a parameter, and **returns** the score

pushups, you could import the module and call it, as follows:

    
    
    pushup_score = fitness_calculator.calculate_pushup_score(45)



To get a single Airman's total score, simply calculate the score for each
category and add them up.

    
    
    score = waist_score + pushup_score + situp_score + run_score



**EXAMPLES:**
