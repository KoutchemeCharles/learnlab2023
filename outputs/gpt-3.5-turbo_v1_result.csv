**Explanation:** 
The program defines a function `meritorious_list` that takes in three parameters - `gpa`, `apa`, `mpa`. The function checks each parameter against the condition and appends the corresponding meritorious list to the `lists` variable. If all three parameters meet the condition, the `lists` variable is overwritten with only the ""Superintendent's List"". The function then returns the `lists` variable.

In the main program, it prompts the user to enter the GPA, APA, and MPA values. It then calls the `meritorious_list` function passing in the user input values. The returned list is stored in the `result` variable. Finally, the program iterates over the `result` list and prints each item."

One byte is comprised of 8 bits. A typical computer program has a requirement
for much more memory. Therefore, many bytes can be grouped together to make
larger memory amounts. Our convention is for computer memory is scaled in
logical increments of 210 = 1024.

the equivalent number of kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

The basic unit of computer memory is a bit. A bit can represent two values (on
or off, 0 or 1). To represent more information, bits are grouped together in
larger quantities. Beyond a bit, the next logical grouping is a byte, where 1
byte has 8 bits. Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits
and then outputs the equivalent number of bytes.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** In this lab, you are being given the freedom to explore `matplotlib`'s
plotting capabilities.

The template ZIP file contains several interesting datasets that we have
collected from the internet (although you are free to include any other
dataset if you wish). Examine these datasets, and generate at least 2
""interesting"" graphs. Each plot should use a different dataset. Additionally,
each plot must be a different type (line and pie graph, etc)

Use the `subplot` feature to make sure all of the graphs fit on one screen.
Most importantly, make sure you label your axes, give your charts a title, use
color, etc.

  
**HINT**

  * Use numpy's `genfromtxt` function to read the values in the file. If you forget how to use this function, refer to the lecture video.

how many years men and women spend in school in different countries. In the
problem, we have provided you with a dataset called `education.csv` that
contains information from various countries about years spent in education.
Here is a typical line from the file:



`Zimbabwe,2010,M,15,64,8.04,5.92,2.09,0.03,3926`



Each position in the line represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key
for your reference:

Country | Year | Gender | Start Age | End Age | Total Years in School |
Primary School | Secondary School | Tertiary School | Population (thousands)  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Zimbabwe | 2010 | M | 15 | 64 | 8.04 | 5.92 | 2.09 | 0.03 | 3926  
  


  
Write a Python program that asks the user for the name of country (e.g.,
""Zimbabwe""), followed by a Gender (""M"" or ""F""). Your program should print the
average number of years that gender spends in school followed by the years
that are greater than or equal to the average.

  
For example, if ""Zimbabwe"" and ""M"" were entered as the country and gender of
interest, respectively, then your program should print out:

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity | Name | Count

Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the most popular and working down.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

The Air Academy Federal Credit Union wants to identify its best customers and
comes to you for help. To help with the accounting, create a Python program
which inputs repeated pairs of member last-names followed by account balances
until the word "" **DONE** "" (all capital letters) is entered at the member
last-name prompt.

Your program should output:

  * The last name of the member the highest account value, if there are two members with the same highest account value it should output the name of the first person entered.
  * It will then output the percentage members who are within $10,000 (inclusive) of the highest account value.

There is no bound on the number of members that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one member and balance entered.

**Explanation:**

- We define a list `squadrons` with `num_groups` number of elements, all initialized to 0. This list will hold the count of squadrons in each group.
- We ask the user to enter the total number of squadrons (`num_squadrons`).
- We then use a loop to iterate `num_squadrons` number of times.
- In each iteration, we ask the user to enter a squadron number (`squadron`).
- We use conditional statements to check which group the squadron belongs to and increment the corresponding element in the `squadrons` list accordingly.
- Finally, we use a loop to print the count of squadrons in each group, one per line."

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.

**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the

destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a dataset called `afpft_v2.csv` that describes how
various Air Force personnel performed on their most recent fitness test. Do
NOT ask the user for the file name--just open and read this specific file.
Here is a typical line from the dataset (each line ends with the newline ""\n""
character):



`38, 52, 29, 568`



Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element,"" or ""column."" The following table shows how the above line can be
interpreted:  
  

  | Sit Ups  
(Reps) | Push Ups  
(Reps) | Waist  
(inches) | 1.5 Mile Run Time  
(seconds)  
---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 45 | 65 | 32 | 630  
  


**Write a Python program that analyzes this file and prints the # of
_unsatisfactory_ (less than 75) scores. **



To assist you, we have provided you with a module called `fitness_calculator`
that contains four functions:

  * calculate_waist_score
  * calculate_pushup_score
  * calculate_situp_score
  * calculate_run_score



Each function takes a single number as a parameter, and **returns** the score
for that category. For example, to get the score for an Airman who did 45
pushups, you could import the module and call it, as follows:

    
    
    pushup_score = fitness_calculator.calculate_pushup_score(45)



To get a single Airman's total score, simply calculate the score for each
category and add them up.

    
    
    score = waist_score + pushup_score + situp_score + run_score



**EXAMPLES:**

If, for example, the number of unsatisfactory scores is 10, your program
should print:

    
    
    **10**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

A 3D printer converts computer generated models into physical objects by
heating and extruding a filament known as Polylactic Acid (PLA). PLA, normally
sold in spools, is directly fed to the printer head like a thread. You want to
determine if you can afford to 3D print a project given its volume of
material.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The volume of the 3D model to be printed (in cm3)
    * The user's budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The length of material (in meters) needed to produce the object
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of materials is greater than or not greater than the user's budget, respectfully.

Assume that each cm3 requires **  0.312** meters of PLA to print, and that PLA
filament costs  **$0.063**  per meter. You may assume that all inputs are non-
negative numbers.



**EXAMPLES:**

  | Example 1 | Example 2

inside of a rectangle, the program plays a different
sound.[](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1762383/files/86200052/download?download_frd=1)

The provided template file comes with a single button implemented. Your job is
to study this code and create at least 5 other buttons. Note: The buttons do
not have to be laid out in the same arrangement, but they should look
organized.

When you are finished, upload your Python code. Do NOT upload any of the sound
files.

    Point(150, 50),
    Point(250, 50),
    Point(50, 150),
    Point(150, 150)

# Define the size of the buttons
button_size = Point(100, 100)

# Create a list to store the button rectangles
buttons = []

# Create a GraphApp object
app = GraphApp(""Soundboard"", 400, 300)

# Create the buttons and add them to the app
for i in range(len(sound_files)):
    button = Rectangle(button_positions[i], button_size)
    button.fill(button_colors[i])
    buttons.append(button)
    app.add(button)

# Create a Text object to display the currently playing sound file
text = Text(Point(200, 250), """")
app.add(text)

# Define a function to handle button click events
def button_click(event):
    for i, button in enumerate(buttons):

# Set the button click handler
app.on_click(button_click)

# Start the app
app.run()
```

This solution creates a soundboard application using the `python_graph` library. It defines a list of sound files, button colors, button positions, and button sizes. Then, it creates a list of button rectangles based on these specifications and adds them to the app. 

When a button is clicked, the program plays the corresponding sound file and updates the display text to show the currently playing sound file.

To run this program, you will need to have the `python_graph` library installed. You can install it using the command `pip install python_graph`."

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You are tasked to paint a large wall and need to see if your unit can afford
the paint for the project

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The size of the wall in square feet
    * The budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The amount of paint required to cover the wall
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of paint is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.

Assume that a gallon of paint covers **15** square feet, and that the current
price of paint is  **$12.23**  per gallon. You may assume that all inputs are
non-negative numbers. You should also assume that you can purchase portions of
gallons of paint so do NOT round up to the nearest full gallon.

One byte is comprised of 8 bits. A typical computer program has a requirement
for much more memory. Therefore, many bytes can be grouped together to make
larger memory amounts. Our convention is for computer memory is scaled in
logical increments of 210 = 1024.

The basic unit of computer memory is a bit. A bit can represent two values (on

larger quantities. Beyond a bit, the next logical grouping is a byte, where 1
byte has 8 bits. Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

**IMPORTANT:  
** You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you
test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you
can comment out your test code).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity  | Name |  Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC  | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the least popular and working up.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Write a Python program that takes two inputs and produces two outputs. NOTE:
This problem does not require creating an additional list to solve.

The inputs from the user are:

  1. A gender, a string which will be MALE or FEMALE
  2. A threshold number for the number of times that a name was used.

Your program will compare the information from the user to the names.csv
dataset, and output two statistics as output:

  1. The count of the number of names that were used above the threshold given for the provided gender
  2. The total count of children with the high usage names and the specified gender. In other words, the sum of the number of children given names above the threshold value from input 2.

**PROBLEM NAME:  
** IterLogic1_dvc



**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.



**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a program that asks the user to type the name of a file (e.g.,
""file.txt""), and a letter. Your program should then open the file, and print
out all of the lines where the first character starts with the letter

For example, if the user types the following filename:

    
    
    input1.txt
    a
    

and the contents of input1.txt are:

    
    
    aspiration
    classified
    federation
    

the output should be:

    
    
    aspiration
    



Notes:

  * Each line ends with the '\n' character. Use `split()` to get each line.
  * Refer to the String Functions slide to see how you can get the first character from a string

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a python program that can calculate the range of a projectile when fired
from an artillery on level ground. Your program will ask the user to input the
initial velocity (`v`) and angle in degrees (`theta`). Your program should
then calculate and print the range using the following formula:

`range = (v^2 * sin(2 * theta)) / 9.8`  
 **WARNING: The above formula is not valid Python.**
