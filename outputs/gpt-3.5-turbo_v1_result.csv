**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

One byte is comprised of 8 bits. A typical computer program has a requirement
for much more memory. Therefore, many bytes can be grouped together to make
larger memory amounts. Our convention is for computer memory is scaled in
logical increments of 210 = 1024.

For example:

  * 1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte (KB)
  * 1024 KB = 1 megabyte (MB)
  * 1024 MB = 1 gigabyte (GB)

Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and then outputs
the equivalent number of kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes.

The basic unit of computer memory is a bit. A bit can represent two values (on
or off, 0 or 1). To represent more information, bits are grouped together in
larger quantities. Beyond a bit, the next logical grouping is a byte, where 1
byte has 8 bits. Write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits
and then outputs the equivalent number of bytes.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---

Boyle's Law states, for an ideal gas, that the pressure (p) multiplied by #
the volume of a container (v) is always constant. So, if we have an initial
pressure and volume (p1 * v1 = k) and we decrease the volume (v2) the pressure
(v2) must increase. The formula for this is

    
    
    p1 * v1 = p2 * v2

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

In Star Trek, starships travel across interstellar space at many times the
speed of light.  Due to the immense speeds involved, velocity in Star Trek is
described using a fictitious unit of measurement known as a ""Warp Factor"".
For reference, Warp Factor 1.0 is equivalent to the speed of light, whereas
Warp Factor 9.0 is more than 700 times faster!

Write a program that asks the user for the number of starships to analyze, as
well as a target distance in light years.  Your program will then get the name
of each starship (e.g., ""USS Enterprise) as well as its maximum cruise speed
(e.g., 9.6), in that order.

Your program will then output the following:

  * The number of days it would take for the fastest starship to travel the target distance
  * The names of all ships that can travel the same distance within 7 days (inclusive) of the fastest time



**HINT:   We have provided you with a function called calculate_travel_time,
which takes a warp factor and distance as parameters, and returns the number
of days it would take to travel that distance.  Call this function to solve
the problem.**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Now that you are a Freshman at USAFA, it might be interesting to learn about
how many years men and women spend in school in different countries. In the
problem, we have provided you with a dataset called `education.csv` that
contains information from various countries about years spent in education.
Here is a typical line from the file:



`Zimbabwe,2010,M,15,64,8.04,5.92,2.09,0.03,3926`



Each position in the line represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key
for your reference:

Country | Year | Gender | Start Age | End Age | Total Years in School |
Primary School | Secondary School | Tertiary School | Population (thousands)  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Zimbabwe | 2010 | M | 15 | 64 | 8.04 | 5.92 | 2.09 | 0.03 | 3926  
  


  
Write a Python program that asks the user for the name of country (e.g.,
""Zimbabwe""), followed by a Gender (""M"" or ""F""). Your program should print the
average number of years that gender spends in school followed by the years
that are greater than or equal to the average.

  
For example, if ""Zimbabwe"" and ""M"" were entered as the country and gender of
interest, respectively, then your program should print out:

**`2.5117241379310347`  
`1960`  
`1965`  
`1970`  
`1975`

This code creates an animation of a bouncing triangle. The triangle's vertices start at random locations and bounce whenever the triangle hits a wall. The code uses the pygame library to create the animation and handles user events, game logic, drawing, and screen updates. The triangle's position and velocity are updated in each frame, and its new position is checked against the walls of the screen. If it hits a wall, its corresponding velocity component is reversed to make it bounce back. The animation runs at a frame rate of 60 frames per second."

**Hints**

  * Import the `random` module in order to generate random numbers. There are specifically two functions that are useful:
  * `random.random()` returns a random number between 0.0 and 1.0
  * `random.randint(start, end)` returns a random integer between `start` and `end`

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity | Name | Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the most popular and working down.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * For this lab, you need to sort the list in descending order, so that the most popular items appear first. To do this, you need to tell the function to sort in reverse. You can do this by typing the following (assuming your list is named `my_list`):  
`my_list.sort(reverse=True)`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

The Air Academy Federal Credit Union wants to identify its best customers and
comes to you for help. To help with the accounting, create a Python program
which inputs repeated pairs of member last-names followed by account balances
until the word "" **DONE** "" (all capital letters) is entered at the member
last-name prompt.

Your program should output:

  * The last name of the member the highest account value, if there are two members with the same highest account value it should output the name of the first person entered.
  * It will then output the percentage members who are within $10,000 (inclusive) of the highest account value.

There is no bound on the number of members that may be entered, but you may

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You have been asked by your unit to record 100m dash times for an upcoming
USAFA track meet. Create a Python algorithm that first asks for the number of
cadets, and then asks for that many cadet last names, squadrons, and 100m dash
times (in that order).

Your program should output:

  * The cadet squadron containing the cadet with the fastest 100m dash time followed by their 100m dash time. If there is a tie for fastest 100m dash times, you should output the squadron number and time for the LAST cadet entered who had that fastest time.
  * The number of cadets whose 100m dash time was faster than the average.

There is no bound on the number of cadet that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one cadet and track time entered.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Allow the user to enter names one at a time until they type the word 'END'
(without quotes). This keyword is called a  **sentinel value,**  and it marks
the end of the input. The user entered names (not counting 'END') are to be
stored in a Python list. The user will enter the names one at a time. After
entering all the names, your algorithm will print the names in the reverse
order that they were entered.

  * Remember that the range() function can have up to 3 parameters. The first is the starting value, the second is the ending value, and the third is the increment amount.
  * Don't forget that the index of a list starts at 0, and goes to the length of the list - 1. For example, a list with 5 elements has indices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  * To get the length of a list, use the `len()` function

`17245.8*A ND17/35, RICKETYBACK FIELD, 2600, 100, TURF`



  
Each position in the line represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key
for your reference:

  | Location ID | Name | Runway Length (in feet) | Runway Width (in feet) |
Runway Type  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 17245.8*A ND17/35 | RICKETYBACK FIELD | 2600 | 100 | TURF  
  
  
  
Write a Python program that asks the user for the name of the file containing
the Runways dataset, as well as the length and width of the runway. Your
program should print the Location ID of every runway whose length and width
meets or exceeds the specified values.

For example, if the user types 4000 and 100 for length and width,
respectively, your program should output:

    
    
    17265. _A ND03/21  
     17265._A ND13/31  
    17302. _A ND13/31  
     17304._A ND14/32  
    17367. _A ND13/31  
     17417.5_A ND11/29  
    17418. _A ND08/26  
     17418._A ND13/31  
    17328. _A ND09/27  
     17328._A ND18/36  
    17347. _A ND08/26  
     17349.1_A ND08/26  
    17349.1 _A ND17R/3

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a program that asks the user to type the name of a file (e.g.,
""file.txt""), and a letter. Your program should then open the file, and print
out all of the lines where the first character starts with the letter

For example, if the user types the following filename:

    
    
    input1.txt
    a
    

and the contents of input1.txt are:

    
    
    aspiration
    classified
    federation
    

the output should be:

    
    
    aspiration
    



Notes:

  * Each line ends with the '\n' character. Use `split()` to get each line.
  * Refer to the String Functions slide to see how you can get the first character from a string

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.

**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

def caesar_decrypt(cipher_text, shift):

```
This solution defines a `caesar_cipher` function that takes in a `text` input and a `shift` value. It iterates over each character in the `text` and if the character is a letter, it applies the Caesar cipher transformation based on the shift value. The transformed character is then appended to a result string. If the character is not a letter, it is simply appended to the result string as is.

The `caesar_encrypt` and `caesar_decrypt` functions are defined as wrappers around the `caesar_cipher` function, with the `shift` value passed to it.

To use this solution, you can call the `caesar_encrypt` function with the plaintext you want to encrypt and the desired shift value. Similarly, you can call the `caesar_decrypt` function with the ciphertext you want to decrypt and the corresponding shift value."

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a dataset called `afpft_v2.csv` that describes how
various Air Force personnel performed on their most recent fitness test. Do
NOT ask the user for the file name--just open and read this specific file.
Here is a typical line from the dataset (each line ends with the newline ""\n""
character):



`38, 52, 29, 568`



Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element,"" or ""column."" The following table shows how the above line can be
interpreted:  
  

  | Sit Ups  
(Reps) | Push Ups  
(Reps) | Waist  
(inches) | 1.5 Mile Run Time  
(seconds)  
---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 45 | 65 | 32 | 630  
  


**Write a Python program that analyzes this file and prints the # of
_unsatisfactory_ (less than 75) scores. **



To assist you, we have provided you with a module called `fitness_calculator`
that contains four functions:

  * calculate_waist_score
  * calculate_pushup_score
  * calculate_situp_score
  * calculate_run_score



Each function takes a single number as a parameter, and **returns** the score
for that category. For example, to get the score for an Airman who did 45
pushups, you could import the module and call it, as follows:

    
    
    pushup_score = fitness_calculator.calculate_pushup_score(45)



To get a single Airman's total score, simply calculate the score for each
category and add them up.

    
    
    score = waist_score + pushup_score + situp_score + run_score



**EXAMPLES:**

If, for example, the number of unsatisfactory scores is 10, your program

You have been provided with a dataset called `legos.csv` that contains
information about various Lego sets. Here is a typical line from the dataset
(each line ends with the newline ""\n"" character):



`10197-1,Fire Brigade,2009,City,2236`



Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element,"" or ""column."" The following table shows how the above line can be
interpreted:  
  

  | Set Number | Name | Year | Theme | Number of Parts  
---|---|---|---|---|---

    25, Pikachu, Electric, 35, 55, 40, 50, 50, 90, 1, FALSE



Each position in the line represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key
for your reference:

  | **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Hit Points** | **Attack** | **Defense** |
**Special Attack** | **Special Defense** | **Speed** | **Generation** |
**Legendary**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 25 | Pikachu | Electric | 35 | 55 | 40 | 50 | 50 | 90 | 1 | False  
  


Write a program that asks the user for:

  * a Pokemon Type (e.g., ""Electric""). 



Your program should then analyze the file and print:

  * The highest attack rating from a Pokemon with the matching type
  * The name of the Pokemon with the highest attack rating. In the event of a tie, print out the name of the FIRST Pokemon with the highest attack value.



**EXAMPLE:  
** If, for example, the Electric Pokemon with the highest attack rating is
Raichu (with an attack of 90.0), your program should print out:

    
    
    90.0  
    Raichu



NOTE: The above answer is purely hypothetical. Your answer will be different.

    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of boards is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.



Assume your local lumberyard sells each board in **5.33** feet pieces at

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The length of runway to be built (in meters)
    * The base's budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)



Your program should then output:

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

A 3D printer converts computer generated models into physical objects by
heating and extruding a filament known as Polylactic Acid (PLA). PLA, normally
sold in spools, is directly fed to the printer head like a thread. You want to
determine if you can afford to 3D print a project given its volume of
material.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The volume of the 3D model to be printed (in cm3)
    * The user's budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The length of material (in meters) needed to produce the object
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of materials is greater than or not greater than the user's budget, respectfully.

Assume that each cm3 requires **  0.312** meters of PLA to print, and that PLA
filament costs  **$0.063**  per meter. You may assume that all inputs are non-
negative numbers.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a Python program that obtains two whole numbers that represent the start
and stop values for a range of numbers. You may assume the second number is
always greater than the first.

Using these start and stop values, print the two following items in order:

1.  Print a list that starts at the start value and ends at (the list contains) the stop value

**HINT** : Use `range()` to accomplish this. In order to print the result from
range() as a list, surround it with list(), `list(range(#,#))`, like you
surround input() with int() or float(), `int(input())`.

2.  Print the size (how many numbers are contained) of that list

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You are provided a list of PFT scores, already in the lab template, in a
variable `pft_scores` arranged in no particular order.

Write a Python program that obtains a new score from the user. If the score is
valid (above zero and no greater than 500), add it to the list and print out
the following two stats in this order:

1\. **average score  ** HINT: use the functions `len()` and `sum()` on your
list to find the average

2\. **range of scores** , the difference between the largest score and
smallest score. HINT: use the functions `min()` and `max()` on your list to
find the range

If the score is invalid (below zero or above 500), instead print:  ""Invalid
score provided"".

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity  | Name |  Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC  | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the least popular and working up.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a Python program that takes two inputs and produces two outputs. NOTE:
This problem does not require creating an additional list to solve.

The inputs from the user are:

  1. A gender, a string which will be 'MALE' or 'FEMALE'
  2. A threshold number for the number of times that a name was used.

Your program will compare the information from the user to the 'names.csv'
dataset, and output two statistics as output:

  1. The count of the number of names that were used above the threshold given for the provided gender
  2. The total count of children with the high usage names and the specified gender. In other words, the sum of the number of children given names above the threshold value from input 2.



This problem makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:

`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`

Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a Python algorithm that opens the file and outputs the lowest (minimum)
traffic count.  Then, output the name of all streets whose traffic count is
within 2500 (inclusive) of the minimum.



This program makes use of the traffic.csv dataset. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`691,6067 North,Kimball Ave,8/15/06,15600,North Bound:7500/South Bound:8100`



As you will recall from class, each position in the line (separated by a
comma) represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key for your
reference:

ID | Address | Street | Sample Date | Total # of Passing Vehicles | # of
Vehicles by Direction  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
691 | 6067 North | Kimball Ave | 8/15/06 | 15600 | North Bound:7500/South
Bound:8100  
  
  
  
Output one street name per line.



For example, if the min traffic count is 500, and the roads within 2500 of
this value are ""Road A"", ""Road B"", ""Road C"", then your program should output:

    
    
    500

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a Python function called `get_movies` that takes three parameters:

  * A two-dimensional list containing movie titles and other stats (see table below for an example)
  * A rating (e.g., ""PG"", ""R"")
  * A run time (in minutes)



Title | Release Year | Rating | Run Time (minutes)  
---|---|---|---  
Star Wars: A New Hope | 1977 | PG | 121  
Star Trek: The Motion Picture | 1979 | G | 132  
Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark | 1989 | PG | 115  
  
  
Your function should return the number of movies that have the specified
rating, and run for at least the number of minutes specified.



**EXAMPLE:**  
If the above table were contained within a list called `movie_table`, then
`get_movies(movie_table, ""PG"", 100)` should return 2.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

The cadet intercollegiate golf team needs some help tracking individual
performance. Create a Python algorithm that inputs repeated pairs of cadet
last-names followed by the golfers score until the word **END** (all capital
letters) is entered at the member last-name prompt.

Your algorithm should output:

  * The last name of the member with the lowest (best) score, if there are two members with the same lowest score, it should output the last name of the first person entered.
  * The percentage of members who are within 5 strokes (inclusive) of the lowest score.

There is no bound on the number of golfers that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one golfer and score entered.

highest and lowest fare for that passenger class, and print out the result to
a file called ""result.txt"".

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This program makes use of the Titanic dataset. Here is a typical line from the
file:

`0,3,Mr. Owen Harris Braund,male,22,1,0,7.25`

  
As you will undoubtedly recall from class, each position in the line
represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key for your reference:

  | Survived  
(0=False; 1=True) | Class | Name | Gender | Age | Siblings/Spouses Aboard  
(0=False; 1=True) | Parents/Children Aboard  
(0=False; 1=True) | Fare  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 0 | 3 | Mr. Owen Harris Braund | male | 22 | 1 | 0 | 7.25  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that asks the user for the name of the file
containing the titanic dataset, and counts how many males/females survived.
Your program should print out each answer to a file called ""result.txt"".

For example, if 400 men, and 700 women survived, your output file should
contain:  
400  
700



**NOTE: When you print to a file, make sure you put a new line at the end of
each answer!**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

**IMPORTANT:  
** You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you
test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you
can comment out your test code).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a dataset called `legos.csv` that contains
information about various Lego sets. Here is a typical line from the dataset
(each line ends with the newline ""\n"" character):



`10197-1,Fire Brigade,2009,City,2236`



Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element,"" or ""column."" The following table shows how the above line can be
interpreted:  
  

  | Set Number | Name | Year | Theme | Number of Parts  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 10197-1 | Fire Brigade | 2009 | City | 2236  
  


Write a Python program that asks the user for:

  * A Theme (e.g., ""City"")



Your program should then read the file and print on separate lines:

  * The maximum number of parts in a set of the given theme, and
  * The names of all Lego sets that are of this **particular theme** , and within 150 (inclusive) of the maximum part count



**EXAMPLES:**

  | **Example 1**  
---|---  
Input |

Duplo  
  
Output |

250

XXL 250 Canister

Giant Tower

Large Creative Box

  * **the_string** :  A colon-separated string.  
Example: johnson81:4081:30no86:cj4081:Craig:Johnson:Depot:London

  * **column_to_print** :  A number representing which item from the string to print.  
NOTE:  0 indicates the first item in the string, 1 indicates the second, etc.

Add code to this program that:

  1. Splits the_string into separate items.
  2. Prints the number of items that result from splitting the_string (not the number of characters in the string).
  3. Prints the item indicated by the column_to_print value.

**EXAMPLE:**

If the user types:

    
    
    johnson81:4081:30no86:cj4081:Craig:Johnson:Depot:London

Recreational SCUBA divers have to plan out how many air tanks they will need
in order to safely dive. The amount varies per diver because each person
consumes air at a different rate. This rate is commonly called Surface Air
Consumption. You want to figure whether you can afford the air requirements
for the trips that you are planning.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The total dive time for the trip in minutes 
    * The air budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The number of liters needed for the project.
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of compressed air is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.



Assume that your Surface Air Consumption is **14.5** liters/minute, and that
air costs **2 cents** per liter. You may assume that all inputs are non-
negative numbers.

## Comp Sci 110 Spring 2022 Course Project

Objective: Create a flight simulator for NASA's Ingenuity helicopter to
develop flight control skills and an auto-pilot to maximize mapped area.

Instructions: Read writeup (Writeup.pdf) and use the Project Template File to
begin work. Upon completion of each project spiral, upload both your Test
Procedures MS Word document and your Python Code to the respective assignment.

  

### Spiral 3 Submission

**TURN IN INSTRUCTIONS**

You will submit the following two files for this portion of the project.

  1. **Spiral Test Procedures and Results:    **Test Procedures & Results MS Word document using the naming convention of LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_Tests_Spiral_N.docx, so Jane Smiths Spiral 2 Test Procedures and Results file would be named, Smith_Jane_Tests_Spiral_2.docx.  NOTE: Each Spirals Test Procedures & Results needs to include the previous Spiral(s) entries. If the results for any of the previous Spirals have changed, they should be updated accordingly.
  2. **Code Submission:**    Ingenuity simulator Python code using the naming convention of CS110_Ingenuity_Simulator_Spiral_N.py with N as the Spiral number. For example, your Spiral 1 Python file should be named CS110_Ingenuity_Simulator_Spiral_1.py. Importantly, be sure that your name is in the initial comments within your file.
  3. (Optional) **Support Files:**   For example image files.

**HELP POLICY**

  *     * **AUTHORIZ** **ED** **   RESOURCES:   **Any, except another cadets code or test procedures.
    * **NOTE:**
      * Never copy another persons work and submit it as your own.
      * Do not jointly create a program.
      * You must document all help received from sources other than an instructor.
      * DFCS will recommend a course grade of F for any cadet who egregiously violates this Help Policy or contributes to a violation by others.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You have been provided with a dataset containing information about various
types of Pokemon. Here is an example entry from the file:

    
    
    25, Pikachu, Electric, 35, 55, 40, 50, 50, 90, 1, FALSE



Each position in the line represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key
for your reference:

  | **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Hit Points** | **Attack** | **Defense** |
**Special Attack** | **Special Defense** | **Speed** | **Generation** |
**Legendary**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 25 | Pikachu | Electric | 35 | 55 | 40 | 50 | 50 | 90 | 1 | False  
  


Write a program that asks the user for:

  * a Pokemon Type (e.g., ""Electric""). 



Your program should then analyze the file and print:

  * The highest attack rating from a Pokemon with the matching type
  * The name of the Pokemon with the highest attack rating. In the event of a tie, print out the name of the FIRST Pokemon with the highest attack value.



**EXAMPLE:  
** If, for example, the Electric Pokemon with the highest attack rating is
Raichu (with an attack of 90.0), your program should print out:

    
    
    90.0  
    Raichu



NOTE: The above answer is purely hypothetical. Your answer will be different.

One byte is comprised of 8 bits. A typical computer program has a requirement
for much more memory. Therefore, many bytes can be grouped together to make
larger memory amounts. Our convention is for computer memory is scaled in
logical increments of 210 = 1024.

For example:

  * 1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte (KB)
  * 1024 KB = 1 megabyte (MB)
  * 1024 MB = 1 gigabyte (GB)

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** You have been provided with a table that describes a simple night sky as a
2D list in your code template.  This list is an exact mapping to the picture
below.  The 2D list (`star_map`) is populated with characters representing the
locations of various astronomical entities (stars, planets, etc).  For
example, you can see in the template that the very first item is 'M', since
there is a Moon in the top left corner.



Write a program that gets two values from the user in the following order:

  1. The horizontal index of the cell in the star map to search (e.g. 0 for the top row)
  2. The vertical index of the cell in the star map to search (e.g. 0 for the leftmost column)



Finally, **print  ** ****out the word associated with the code in the table at

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

In this problem, we look at total time spent in school (in years) at different
points in history for a particular country.

The provided dataset (`education.csv`) contains information from various
countries about time spent in education gathered as specific years. Here is a
typical line from the file, in this case data gathered in the year 2010 for
the country Zimbabwe:



`Zimbabwe,2010,M,15,64,8.04,3926`



Each position in the line represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key
for your reference:

**Country** | **Year Data Was Gathered** | **Gender** | **Start Age** | **End
Age** |

**Total Time in School (years)**

| **Population (thousands)**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Zimbabwe | 2010 | M | 15 | 64 | 8.04 | 3926  
  


  
Write a Python program that asks the user for:

  1. Name of a country (e.g., ""Zimbabwe"")
  2. A Gender (""M"" or ""F"")

Your program should print:

  * Average total time spent in school for the user provided gender in the user provided country
  * For the given country/gender ONLY, print each ""Year Data was Gathered"" where the ""Total Time in School"" was greater than (inclusive) the average time spent in school

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

**IMPORTANT:  
** You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you
test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you
can comment out your test code).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity  | Name |  Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC  | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the least popular and working up.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

Write a Python program that takes two inputs and produces two outputs. NOTE:
This problem does not require creating an additional list to solve.

The inputs from the user are:

  1. A gender, a string which will be MALE or FEMALE
  2. A threshold number for the number of times that a name was used.

Your program will compare the information from the user to the names.csv
dataset, and output two statistics as output:

  1. The count of the number of names that were used above the threshold given for the provided gender
  2. The total count of children with the high usage names and the specified gender. In other words, the sum of the number of children given names above the threshold value from input 2.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

The Air Academy Federal Credit Union wants to identify its best customers and
comes to you for help. To help with the accounting, create a Python program
which inputs repeated pairs of member last-names followed by account balances
until the word **DONE** (all capital letters) is entered at the member last-
name prompt.

Your program should output:

  * The last name of the member with the highest account value, if there are two members with the same highest account value it should output the name of the first person entered.
  * It will then output the percentage members who are within $10,000 (inclusive) of the highest account value.

There is no bound on the number of members that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one member and balance entered.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You have been asked by your unit to record 100m dash times for an upcoming
USAFA track meet. Create a Python algorithm that first asks for the number of
cadets, and then asks for that many cadet last names, squadrons, and 100m dash
times (in that order).

Your program should output:

  * The cadet squadron containing the cadet with the fastest 100m dash time followed by their 100m dash time. If there is a tie for fastest 100m dash times, you should output the squadron number and time for the LAST cadet entered who had that fastest time.
  * The number of cadets whose 100m dash time was faster than the average.

There is no bound on the number of cadets that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one cadet and track time entered.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You are provided a list of PFT scores, already in the lab template, in a
variable `pft_scores` arranged in no particular order.

Write a Python program that obtains a new score from the user. If the score is
valid (above zero and no greater than 500), add it to the list and print out
the following two stats in this order:

1\. **average score  ** HINT: use the functions `len()` and `sum()` on your
list to find the average

2\. **range of scores** , the difference between the largest score and
smallest score. HINT: use the functions `min()` and `max()` on your list to
find the range

If the score is invalid (below zero or above 500), instead print:  ""Invalid
score provided"".

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a Python program that obtains two whole numbers that represent the start
and stop values for a range of numbers. You may assume the second number is
always greater than the first.

Using these start and stop values, print the two following items in order:

1.  Print a list that starts at the start value and ends at (the list contains) the stop value

**HINT** : Use `range()` to accomplish this. In order to print the result from
range() as a list, surround it with list(), `list(range(#,#))`, like you
surround input() with int() or float(), `int(input())`.

2.  Print the size (how many numbers are contained) of that list

**PROBLEM NAME:  
** IterLogic1_dvc



**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.



**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).


The answer should be code only, please do not provide explanations. Please put the answer within the fenced code block. ","def get_years_until(target):
  maintenance = 623.00
  years = 0
  
  while maintenance <= target:
    maintenance = maintenance * 1.015
    years += 1

  return years"

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Write a program that asks the user to type the name of a file (e.g.,
""file.txt""), and a letter. Your program should then open the file, and print
out all of the lines where the first character starts with the letter

For example, if the user types the following filename:

    
    
    input1.txt
    a
    

and the contents of input1.txt are:

    
    
    aspiration
    classified
    federation
    

the output should be:

    
    
    aspiration
    



Notes:

  * Each line ends with the '\n' character. Use `split()` to get each line.
  * Refer to the String Functions slide to see how you can get the first character from a string


The answer should be code only, please do not provide explanations. Please put the answer within the fenced code block. ","

The City Manager is having a traffic problem and asked you are to write a
program that will determine whether or not to activate a newly installed
alternate traffic light schedule to help alleviate traffic throughout the city
during peak traffic hours. Your program will ask for the number of traffic
""time periods"" to analyze. It will then ask for the traffic throughput (in
average number of cars per minute, which does not have to be a whole number)
for each ""time period"". Your program will keep track of how many ""time
periods"" are considered heavy traffic, as defined as 15 cars per minutes or
more (inclusive). Your program will then print one of the following
statements:

**# of ""time periods"" of heavy traffic** | **0** | **1-2** | **> 2**

Recreational SCUBA divers have to plan out how many air tanks they will need
in order to safely dive. The amount varies per diver because each person
consumes air at a different rate. This rate is commonly called Surface Air
Consumption. You want to figure whether you can afford the air requirements
for the trips that you are planning.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The total dive time for the trip in minutes 
    * The air budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The number of liters needed for the project.
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of compressed air is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.



Assume that your Surface Air Consumption is **14.5** liters/minute, and that
air costs **2 cents** per liter. You may assume that all inputs are non-
negative numbers.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

A 3D printer converts computer generated models into physical objects by
heating and extruding a filament known as Polylactic Acid (PLA). PLA, normally
sold in spools, is directly fed to the printer head like a thread. You want to
determine if you can afford to 3D print a project given its volume of
material.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The volume of the 3D model to be printed (in cm3)
    * The user's budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The length of material (in meters) needed to produce the object
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of materials is greater than or not greater than the user's budget, respectfully.

Assume that each cm3 requires **  0.312** meters of PLA to print, and that PLA
filament costs  **$0.063**  per meter. You may assume that all inputs are non-
negative numbers.



**EXAMPLES:**

  | Example 1 | Example 2  
---|---|---  
Input | 15.0  
2.5 | 500.0

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

You are tasked to paint a large wall and need to see if your unit can afford
the paint for the project

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The size of the wall in square feet
    * The budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The amount of paint required to cover the wall
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of paint is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.

Assume that a gallon of paint covers **15** square feet, and that the current
price of paint is  **$12.23**  per gallon. You may assume that all inputs are
non-negative numbers. You should also assume that you can purchase portions of
gallons of paint so do NOT round up to the nearest full gallon.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:  

Write the Python code needed to get three values from the user:

  1. A string representing the name of a cadet squadron (e.g., Grim Reapers). Store this value in a variable called sqd_name
  2. A floating point value representing average age for all cadets in the squadron. Store this value in a variable called sqd_avg_age
  3. An integer representing the weight of the ICBM in kilograms. Store this value in a variable called sqd_number

IMPORTANT: Your template file contains a print statement that combines these
values to produce an output (see Example). Do not modify this line. Simply add
your input statements in the space provided.
