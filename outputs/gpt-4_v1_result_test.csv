**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are
composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The
number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated
to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a
single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or
white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to
have one of four colors.

Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular
pixel can be described as:

    
    
    numberofcolors = 2number of bits

In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and
then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a
single pixel.

**EXAMPLE:**

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3  
---|---|---|---

information about male oscar award winners from the 1920s to 2015. Here is a
typical line from the file:

    
    
    1928,44,Emil Jannings,The Last Command

As always, each data element corresponds to a different piece of information.
Here is a table that describes how to interpret each column:

**Year** | **Actor Age** | **Name** | **Film**  
---|---|---|---  
1928 | 44 | Emil Jannings | The Last Command  
  


Write a Python program that reads this file, and gets the following inputs
from the user:

  *     * A start year
    * An end year

Your program should output the age of the youngest actor during that time span
(including the start and end years), as well as the names of all actors that
are within 5 years (inclusive) of the youngest age. For simplicity's sake,
don't try to calculate the current age of the actors; just go with what is in
the file.



For example, if the youngest actor is 25, and the names of the actors within 5
years of the youngest age are Bob and Tom, your program should output:  
  
25  
Bob  
Tom

In Star Trek, starships travel across interstellar space at many times the
speed of light.  Due to the immense speeds involved, velocity in Star Trek is

For reference, Warp Factor 1.0 is equivalent to the speed of light, whereas
Warp Factor 9.0 is more than 700 times faster!

Write a program that asks the user for the number of starships to analyze, as
well as a target distance in light years.  Your program will then get the name
of each starship (e.g., ""USS Enterprise) as well as its maximum cruise speed
(e.g., 9.6), in that order.

Your program will then output the following:

  * The number of days it would take for the fastest starship to travel the target distance
  * The names of all ships that can travel the same distance within 7 days (inclusive) of the fastest time



**HINT:   We have provided you with a function called calculate_travel_time,

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** In this lab, you are being given the freedom to explore `matplotlib`'s
plotting capabilities.

The template ZIP file contains several interesting datasets that we have
collected from the internet (although you are free to include any other
dataset if you wish). Examine these datasets, and generate at least 2
""interesting"" graphs. Each plot should use a different dataset. Additionally,
each plot must be a different type (line and pie graph, etc)

Use the `subplot` feature to make sure all of the graphs fit on one screen.
Most importantly, make sure you label your axes, give your charts a title, use
color, etc.

  
**HINT**

  * Use numpy's `genfromtxt` function to read the values in the file. If you forget how to use this function, refer to the lecture video.

The above code assumes that the data files are named `data1.txt` and `data2.txt` and are located in the same directory. This code first loads these datasets using numpy's `genfromtxt` function. Then, it creates a figure that is 10 inches wide and 5 inches tall.

In the first subplot, it plots `data1` as a line plot and labels the plot and axes. In the second subplot, it plots `data2` as a pie chart and labels the pie chart.

Finally, it adjusts the subplot parameters to give specified padding between subplots and shows the plot. 

Please replace 'Data1 Plot', 'Data2 Pie Chart', 'X-axis Label', and 'Y-axis Label', with appropriate labels relevant to your datasets.

You can replace data1.txt and data2.txt with the names of your dataset files. Also, adjust plot types, labels, title, and colors as per your data and requirements."

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

Now that you are a Freshman at USAFA, it might be interesting to learn about
how many years men and women spend in school in different countries. In the
problem, we have provided you with a dataset called `education.csv` that
contains information from various countries about years spent in education.
Here is a typical line from the file:



`Zimbabwe,2010,M,15,64,8.04,5.92,2.09,0.03,3926`



Each position in the line represents a different ""data element"". Here is a key
for your reference:

Country | Year | Gender | Start Age | End Age | Total Years in School |
Primary School | Secondary School | Tertiary School | Population (thousands)  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Zimbabwe | 2010 | M | 15 | 64 | 8.04 | 5.92 | 2.09 | 0.03 | 3926  
  


  
Write a Python program that asks the user for the name of country (e.g.,
""Zimbabwe""), followed by a Gender (""M"" or ""F""). Your program should print the
average number of years that gender spends in school followed by the years
that are greater than or equal to the average.

  
For example, if ""Zimbabwe"" and ""M"" were entered as the country and gender of
interest, respectively, then your program should print out:

**`2.5117241379310347`  
`1960`  
`1965`  
`1970`  
`1975`

However, below is a general approach for creating a GUI based soundboard application in Python using the libraries tkinter (for the GUI) and pygame (for playing sounds).

```python
import pygame
from tkinter import *

root = Tk()

def play_sound1():
    pygame.mixer.init()
    pygame.mixer.music.load(""sound1.wav"")  # Insert your sound file here
    pygame.mixer.music.play()

def play_sound2():
    pygame.mixer.init()
    pygame.mixer.music.load(""sound2.wav"")  # Insert your sound file here
    pygame.mixer.music.play()

def play_sound3():
    pygame.mixer.init()
    pygame.mixer.music.load(""sound3.wav"")  # Insert your sound file here
    pygame.mixer.music.play()

def play_sound4():
    pygame.mixer.init()
    pygame.mixer.music.load(""sound4.wav"")  # Insert your sound file here
    pygame.mixer.music.play()

def play_sound5():
    pygame.mixer.init()
    pygame.mixer.music.load(""sound5.wav"")  # Insert your sound file here
    pygame.mixer.music.play()

# Create buttons
Button(root, text=""Play Sound 1"", command=play_sound1).pack()
Button(root, text=""Play Sound 2"", command=play_sound2).pack()
Button(root, text=""Play Sound 3"", command=play_sound3).pack()
Button(root, text=""Play Sound 4"", command=play_sound4).pack()
Button(root, text=""Play Sound 5"", command=play_sound5).pack()

root.mainloop()
```
The above script will create a simple GUI window with five buttons. When you press each button, different sounds will be played. Please replace ""sound1.wav"", ""sound2.wav"" etc with your actual sound file paths."

The above code snipped writes the whole pygame application where a circle is drawn to the screen at the position, where the left mouse button is held down. This position is gotten from pygame.mouse.get_pos(), which returns the x and y coordinates of the mouse and these coordinates are handed to pygame.draw.circle, which draws the circle at them. When the MOUSEBUTTONDOWN event is caught, clicking is set to True, when the MOUSEBUTTONUP event is caught, it is set to False again. The checking of the 'clicking' variable and drawing of the circle therefore only happens when the mouse button is held down."

The answer should be code only, please do not provide explanations. Please put the answer within the fenced code block. The skeleton code should be included in your answer.","Here is a solution that uses functionality from the turtle graphics library in Python. This library allows for fairly easy creation of animation compared to other Python graphics libraries.

```python
import turtle
import random

# Set up screen
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor(""black"")

# Set up turtle (ball)
ball = turtle.Turtle()
ball.shape(""circle"")
ball.color(""white"")
ball.penup()
ball.speed(0)

# Ball movement details
ball.dx = random.randint(3, 5) * random.choice([-1, 1])
ball.dy = random.randint(3, 5) * random.choice([-1, 1])


def switch_color():
    colors = [""white"", ""blue"", ""red"", ""green"", ""yellow"", ""purple"", ""orange""]
    ball.color(random.choice(colors))

while True:
    ball.setx(ball.xcor() + ball.dx)
    ball.sety(ball.ycor() + ball.dy)

    # Border collision
    if ball.xcor() > 390:
        ball.dx *= -1
        switch_color()
    if ball.xcor() < -390:
        ball.dx *= -1
        switch_color()
    if ball.ycor() > 290:
        ball.dy *= -1
        switch_color()
    if ball.ycor() < -290:
        ball.dy *= -1
        switch_color()

    wn.update()
```

Please note that the ball starts from the middle of the screen but with a random speed and direction. It changes the color randomly each time it hits the wall. Closing the turtle window will generate an error in this infinite loop. You can handle termination more gracefully if needed for your application."

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over
1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from
the file:



`FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21`



  
Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element"". Here is a key for your reference:

Gender | Ethnicity | Name | Count  
(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)  
---|---|---|---  
FEMALE | HISPANIC | GIA | 21  
  
  
  
Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, ""MALE"" or ""FEMALE"") and
a number, `X`, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for
that gender, starting with the most popular and working down.

For example, if the user types `MALE` and `2`, and you determine that the two
least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:

    
    
    Bill  
    Ted  
      
    



**HINTS (really really important):**

  * Remember that you can use the `sort()` function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named `my_list`, you can sort it by typing:  
`my_list.sort()`

  * `sort()` will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.

Write a Python algorithm that opens the file and outputs the lowest traffic
count. Then, output the name of all streets whose traffic count is within 2500
(inclusive) of the min. Output one street name per line.



For example, if the min value is 500, and the roads within 2500 of this value
are ""Road A"", ""Road B"", ""Road C"", then your program should output:

    
    
    500  
    Road A  
    Road B  
    Road C

Problem description:


**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You have been asked by your unit to record 100m dash times for an upcoming
USAFA track meet. Create a Python algorithm that first asks for the number of
cadets, and then asks for that many cadet last names, squadrons, and 100m dash
times (in that order).

Your program should output:

  * The cadet squadron containing the cadet with the fastest 100m dash time followed by their 100m dash time. If there is a tie for fastest 100m dash times, you should output the squadron number and time for the LAST cadet entered who had that fastest time.
  * The number of cadets whose 100m dash time was faster than the average.

There is no bound on the number of cadet that may be entered, but you may
assume that there will be at least one cadet and track time entered.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
** The CS110Z course director, unfortunately, was tricked into purchasing a
Disney Vacation Club timeshare. The good news about DVC is that it lets you
reserve a room at any Disney Resort for one week! The downside, however, is
that members have to pay an annual ""maintenance fee"" so that the mouse can
keep the property looking good (EVEN when Disney World was closed due to
COVID-19 . . . yay).

This year, the maintenance was $623.00. If that isn't bad enough, your course
director discovered that maintenance fees aren't fixed! On the contrary, it
accues each year at a rate of approximately 1.5%.

Write a Python function called `get_years_until` that takes a  **target
value**  as a parameter, and returns the number of years (assuming a fixed
interest rate) before the maintenance fee exceeds this value.

**Example 1**  
`get_years_until(624)` should return 1. This is because:

  * The maintenance fee will increase by $9.35 (i.e., 1.5% of 623) in a year
  * The new maintenance fee will be $623.00 + $9.35 = $632.35, which is obviously more than $624.00

**  
Example 2**  
`get_years_until(1000)` should return 32. This is because:

  * 623 * 1.015 * 1.015 * 1.015 . . . (32 times total) = $1003.23, which is obviously more than $1000.00

  
**Don't Know Where to Start?!?**  
Use a While loop to keep calculating the new maintenance fee until the value
is . . . (we'll let you figure out the rest).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

**

You have been provided with a dataset called `afpft_v2.csv` that describes how
various Air Force personnel performed on their most recent fitness test. Do
NOT ask the user for the file name--just open and read this specific file.
Here is a typical line from the dataset (each line ends with the newline ""\n""
character):



`38, 52, 29, 568`



Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different ""data
element,"" or ""column."" The following table shows how the above line can be
interpreted:  
  

  | Sit Ups  
(Reps) | Push Ups  
(Reps) | Waist  
(inches) | 1.5 Mile Run Time  
(seconds)  
---|---|---|---|---  
Value | 45 | 65 | 32 | 630  
  


**Write a Python program that analyzes this file and prints the # of

To assist you, we have provided you with a module called `fitness_calculator`
that contains four functions:

  * calculate_waist_score
  * calculate_pushup_score
  * calculate_situp_score
  * calculate_run_score



Each function takes a single number as a parameter, and **returns** the score

pushups, you could import the module and call it, as follows:

    
    
    pushup_score = fitness_calculator.calculate_pushup_score(45)



To get a single Airman's total score, simply calculate the score for each
category and add them up.

    
    
    score = waist_score + pushup_score + situp_score + run_score



**EXAMPLES:**

If, for example, the number of unsatisfactory scores is 10, your program

The Academy Athletic Director asked you are to write a program that will
determine whether or not a football game in progress should be delayed based
on current weather conditions. Your program will ask for the number of
lightning strikes occurred in the immediate area in the past thirty minutes.
It will then ask for the distance from Falcon Stadium to each lightning strike
(in miles, which do not have to be whole numbers). Your program will keep
track of how many lightning strikes are within 15 miles of the stadium
(inclusive). Your program will then print one of the following statements:

```python
# Dictionray which stores each missile name and its max range
missiles = {
    ""Hwasong-6"": 500,
    ""KN-11"": 1200,
    ""Musudan BM-25"": 4000,
    ""Hwasong-14"": 8000,
    ""Taepodong-2"": 12000
}

# Initial prompt asking user for target distance
target_distance = int(input(""Enter the distance to target in Kilometers: ""))

# Variable that checks if any missile is in range
in_range = False

# Loop through the dictionary and compare with target distance
for missile, range in missiles.items():
    if range >= target_distance:
        # Print the name of the missile if in range
        print(missile)
        # Set in_range to True
        in_range = True

# If no missile is in range, print ""Not in range""
if not in_range:
    print(""Not in range"")
```
This program uses a dictionary to store the missiles and their maximum range. It then asks the user to input the target distance. It loops through the dictionary and checks if the range of the missile is greater than or equal to the target distance. If it is, the missile name is printed and the `in_range` variable is set to `True`. If no missile has a range greater than or equal to the target distance, the program will print ""Not in range"" at the end."

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

A 3D printer converts computer generated models into physical objects by
heating and extruding a filament known as Polylactic Acid (PLA). PLA, normally
sold in spools, is directly fed to the printer head like a thread. You want to
determine if you can afford to 3D print a project given its volume of
material.

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The volume of the 3D model to be printed (in cm3)
    * The user's budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The length of material (in meters) needed to produce the object
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of materials is greater than or not greater than the user's budget, respectfully.

Assume that each cm3 requires **  0.312** meters of PLA to print, and that PLA
filament costs  **$0.063**  per meter. You may assume that all inputs are non-
negative numbers.

```
This solution uses graphics.py, and a gradient ball that changes color every time it hits a wall. It also animates the ball to bounce around the window. We move the ball in units of 10 in the x and y direction, changing direction when it hits any of the walls by switching sign of the relevant direction vector. The color of the ball is also changed any time it hits a wall. We use a sleep interval of 0.05 seconds to slow down the animation enough to see the ball bounce and change color."

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Write a Python program that obtains two whole numbers that represent the start

always greater than the first.

Using these start and stop values, print the two following items in order:

1.  Print a list that starts at the start value and ends at (the list contains) the stop value

**HINT** : Use `range()` to accomplish this. In order to print the result from
range() as a list, surround it with list(), `list(range(#,#))`, like you
surround input() with int() or float(), `int(input())`.

2.  Print the size (how many numbers are contained) of that list

** Write a function that determines if a point is within a circle. You will
name your function `in_circle()`. It has five parameters:

  1. The coordinates of the point that is to be tested (x, y)
  2. The center of a circle (cir_x, cir_y)
  3. The radius of the circle (radius)

 The `in_circle()` function will return **True** if the point is on or inside
the circle, and **False** otherwise.

**IMPORTANT:  
** You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you
test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you
can comment out your test code).

Problem description:
**PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
**

""Asteroids"" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the
player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets.
The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with
destroying them without running into them.

In this lab, you will write a ""collision detection"" function that will be used
by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this
simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the
asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever
overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more
accurate ways to detect a collision. [Click here if you want to learn more
(Links to an external site.)](https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-
detection/)).

![](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/03/spaceShipAsteroid.png)

Your function, which you will name `detect_collision()` should have six
parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's
radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the
asteroid's radius. Your function will return `True` if the player's ship has
hit the asteroid, and `False` otherwise.

**HINT: _  
_** _You may want to copy and paste the_  `dist_points`  _function you created
earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of
reusable functions . . ._

Write an algorithm that asks for:

  *     * The distance to a target in miles
    * The budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)



Your program should then output:

  *     * The amount of fuel (in gallons) needed to reach the target
    * The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)
    * Either ""Over Budget"" or ""Within Budget"", depending on whether the cost of fuel is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.

Assume that the convoy can get **  12.5** miles to the gallon, and that the
current price of fuel is  **$3.73**  per gallon. You may assume that all
inputs are non-negative numbers.



**EXAMPLES:**

  | Example 1 | Example 2  
---|---|---  
Input | 130.7  
50.50 |

750  
100  
  
Output | 10.456  
39.0009  
Within Budget | 60.0  
223.80  
Over Budget

The answer should be code only, please do not provide explanations. Please put the answer within the fenced code block. The skeleton code should be included in your answer.","Please note that the solution will depend highly on what kind of image you want to draw and what kind of shapes or components you want to use. Also, you need the pythonGraph module installed and an image file (e.g., .png or .jpg) to use the `draw_image` function.

Here is a simple solution that uses `draw_circle`, `draw_rectangle`, `draw_line`, and `draw_image`. This example assumes that you have an image file named 'image.png' in your work directory.

```python
import pythonGraph

# Start a new graphics window. 
pythonGraph.open_window(800, 600)

# Draw a circle using draw_circle function
pythonGraph.draw_circle(200, 200, 50, 'blue', 1)

# Draw a rectangle using draw_rectangle function
pythonGraph.draw_rectangle(400, 200, 100, 50, 'red', 2)

# Draw a line using draw_line function
pythonGraph.draw_line(0, 0, 800, 600, 'green', 3)

# Draw an image using draw_image function
pythonGraph.draw_image('image.png', 600, 400)

# Refresh to make all changes visible
pythonGraph.refresh_window()

# Stay window
pythonGraph.wait_for_close()
```

This code will create a new graphics window, then draw a blue circle, a red rectangle, a green diagonal line and an image in it. You might want to replace `'image.png'` with the actual path to your image.

Remember, part of the task is to experiment with these commands. Feel free to try out different shapes, positions, widths, and colors."
